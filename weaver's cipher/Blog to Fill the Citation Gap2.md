Absolutely! I found a Wikipedia page in the personal finance and African American tech/niche space that contains a "citation needed" tag. Here’s the article:

Article: Lynnette Khalfani-Cox

In the Wikipedia entry for Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, a prominent African American personal finance advisor and author, the "Honors and awards" section includes the following statement:

In 2009, Khalfani-Cox and co-author Susan Beacham received an Excellence in Financial Literacy Education (EIFLE) Award from the Institute for Financial Literacy for her book, The Millionaire Kids Club. The Institute recognized the first three books in the series as Retail Book of the Year in the category of money-management books for children. [citation needed]

This claim lacks a citation, making it a perfect opportunity to bridge that source gap.
