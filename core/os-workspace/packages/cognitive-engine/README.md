🧠 **Revolutionary Cognitive State Engine - The Heart of the Galaxy Engine** 🌟

> The world's first ElizaOS plugin that enables truly cognitive-aware interfaces, transforming 371 OS into a Cognitive Operating Environment.

## 🚀 Revolutionary Innovation

This plugin represents a **paradigm-shifting breakthrough** in human-computer interaction:

- **🎯 Cognitive State Awareness**: First system to recognize that users exist in different cognitive states
- **🌌 Adaptive Interfaces**: UIs that automatically adapt to user cognitive context  
- **🏭 Universe Factory**: Template architecture enabling infinite vertical scaling
- **🤖 Self-Aware Integration**: Seamless coordination with 371 OS autonomous agents

## 🌟 Core Cognitive States

| State | Description | Optimal For |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Executive** | Strategic decision-making | KPIs, planning, coordination |
| **Technical** | Development and analysis | Coding, debugging, system ops |
| **Creative** | Content and design | Marketing, ideation, content |
| **Analytical** | Data and research | Reports, analysis, investigation |
| **Collaborative** | Team coordination | Meetings, communication, management |
| **Learning** | Education and growth | Documentation, skill development |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Phase 1: Manual Mode Switching (Current)
- Manual cognitive state selection
- UI adaptation based on selected state
- Agent behavior modification
- Foundation for advanced features

### Phase 2: Cognitive UI Modes
- ExecutiveMode.tsx for strategic dashboards
- TechnicalMode.tsx for development interfaces
- CreativeMode.tsx for content creation
- Adaptive component architecture

### Phase 3: Proof of Concept
- Manual mode switcher UI component
- Real-time cognitive state transitions
- User experience validation
- Cognitive state mapping documentation

### Phase 4: Intelligent Automation
- ML-driven cognitive state prediction
- Automatic mode switching
- Behavioral pattern learning
- Production cognitive awareness

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Plugin Integration

```typescript
import { CognitiveEnginePlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-cognitive-engine';

// Add to your ElizaOS agent configuration
const agent = new AgentRuntime({
  character: myCharacter,
  plugins: [CognitiveEnginePlugin],
  // ... other config
});
```

### Manual Cognitive Mode Switching

```typescript
// Set cognitive mode manually (Phase 1)
await agent.processAction('SET_COGNITIVE_MODE', {
  state: 'technical',
  userId: 'user123',
  context: {
    recentActions: ['BUILD_PROJECT', 'RUN_TESTS'],
    focusLevel: 'high'
  }
});
```

### Cognitive State Detection

```typescript
// Detect user's cognitive state
await agent.processAction('DETECT_COGNITIVE_STATE', {
  context: {
    timeOfDay: 14,
    recentActions: ['ANALYZE_DATA', 'GENERATE_REPORTS'],
    focusLevel: 'high',
    sessionDuration: 120
  }
});
```

### Galaxy Universe Generation

```typescript
// Generate a cognitive universe for specific vertical
await agent.processAction('GENERATE_UNIVERSE', {
  type: 'ceos-orrery',
  profile: {
    userId: 'ceo123',
    industry: 'technology',
    preferences: { darkMode: true }
  }
});
```
