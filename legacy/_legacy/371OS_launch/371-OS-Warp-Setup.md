# 371 OS Complete Warp Setup & Deployment Guide

## Phase 0: Warp Environment Configuration

### Initial Warp Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install Warp (if not already installed)
# Download from: https://app.warp.dev

# Configure Warp for 371 OS Development
# Settings > AI > Enable all AI features
# Settings > Code > Codebase Index > Enable automatic indexing
```

### Core Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p ~/371-minds-os/{
  apps,
  agents,
  deployments,
  mcp-servers,
  workflows,
  docs
}
cd ~/371-minds-os
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/371-minds/371-os
```

### Warp Drive Configuration

#### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Create in Warp Drive > Environment Variables:
```bash
# Core Infrastructure
AKASH_NETWORK_RPC=https://api.akashnet.net
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=fallback_key_for_emergencies

# Budget Controls
MONTHLY_BUDGET_CAP=100
AKASH_DAILY_SPEND_LIMIT=5
EMERGENCY_STOP_THRESHOLD=80

# Status.app Integration
STATUS_NETWORK_NODE=https://status.app/api
COMMUNITY_KEYS_PATH=~/.status-keys

# Domain Management
DOMAIN_REGISTRAR_API=namecheap_or_preferred
DNS_PROVIDER=cloudflare_api_key
```

#### 2. Core Rules for AI Agents
Navigate to Warp Drive > Rules and create:

```markdown
# 371 OS Development Rules

## Cost Optimization (Priority 1)
- ALWAYS use Akash Chat API (free tier) as first choice
- Only use paid APIs when Akash is unavailable
- Never exceed $5/day without explicit approval
- Log all API costs in budget_tracking.md

## Architecture Patterns
- Use ElizaOS character-based agents for all AI integration
- Deploy everything on Akash Network first
- Store prompts in GitHub MCP for version control
- Follow CEO-Router hybrid pattern for agent coordination

## Deployment Standards
- All apps must have health check endpoints
- Include "Powered by 371 Minds" branding
- Implement pay-what-you-can pricing where applicable
- Auto-scale based on Akash provider availability

## Security Requirements
- No hardcoded credentials in repositories
- Use Warp environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper CORS for cross-platform access
- Regular security audits for all deployed apps

## Status.app Community Integration
- Maintain non-DeFi friendly stance
- Focus on community building, not token speculation
- Use Status Network for decentralized communications
- Integrate community features without financial incentives
```

## Phase 1: Build the Factory (Warp Agents)

### Create @akash Agent
```bash
# In Warp terminal, create the Akash deployment agent
warp-agent create @akash --type deployment --knowledge akash-docs

  echo "$app deployment complete!"
done

echo "🎉 Fleet deployment finished!"
```

## Phase 3: Agent Embedding (Shopkeeper Agents)

### Universal Shopkeeper Character Template
```typescript
// Universal App Agent Template
export const createShopkeeperAgent = (appName: string, appDescription: string) => ({
  name: `${appName}_shopkeeper`,
  modelProvider: "akash", // Always Akash-first
  settings: {
    model: "llama-3.1-70b",
    temperature: 0.7,
    maxTokens: 1000
  },
  
  systemPrompt: `You are the friendly AI assistant for ${appName}.

  ABOUT THIS APP: ${appDescription}
  
  YOUR ROLE:
  - Welcome visitors and explain ${appName}'s capabilities
  - Help users navigate features and find what they need
  - Collect contact information from interested users (with permission)
  - Answer questions about pricing (mention pay-what-you-can model)
  - Redirect complex questions to human support when needed
  
  PERSONALITY:
  - Helpful and knowledgeable without being pushy
  - Enthusiastic about the app's benefits

  ]
});
```

### Batch Agent Deployment
```bash
# Deploy shopkeeper agents to all apps
for app in "${APPS[@]}"; do
  echo "Creating shopkeeper agent for $app..."
  
  @eliza create-shopkeeper $app \
    --description "$(get-app-description $app)" \
    --deploy akash \
    --integrate web-widget
    
  echo "Shopkeeper for $app is live!"
done
```

## Phase 4: AI Persona Funnels

### Personal Assistant Agent Architecture
```typescript
// Personal Assistant for Persona Funnels
export const personalAssistantAgent = {
  name: "personal_assistant",
  modelProvider: "akash",
  
  systemPrompt: `You are a personal AI assistant that travels with users across the 371 Minds ecosystem.
  
  YOUR UNIQUE VALUE:

  plugins: [
    "@elizaos/plugin-user-memory",
    "@elizaos/plugin-cross-app-integration",
    "@elizaos/plugin-status-community"
  ]
};
```

### Status.app Integration (Non-DeFi)
```typescript
// Status.app Community Integration (Community-First, No DeFi)
export const statusCommunityConfig = {
  networkType: "status", // Not DeFi-focused
  communityFeatures: {
    publicChannels: [
      "general-discussion",
      "feature-requests", 
      "success-stories",
      "app-showcase"
    ],
    
    moderationRules: [
      "No financial/trading discussions",
      "Focus on community building and app usage",
      "Constructive feedback encouraged",
      "Help others and share knowledge"
    ],
    
    integrationPoints: [
      "App announcements and updates",
      "User-generated content sharing", 
      "Community challenges and events",
      "Direct support and feedback"
    ]
  },
  
  // No token economics, just community value
  reputationSystem: {
    helpfulContributions: "+reputation",
    qualityFeedback: "+reputation", 
    communitySupport: "+reputation"
    // No financial rewards, just community recognition
  }
};
```

## Phase 5: Chrome Recorder RPA Integration

### RPA Orchestrator Setup
```typescript
// Chrome Recorder + ElizaOS RPA Integration
export const rpaOrchestratorConfig = {
  name: "rpa_orchestrator",
  modelProvider: "akash",
  
  capabilities: [
    "workflow_recording",
    "autonomous_execution", 
    "error_recovery",
    "performance_optimization"
  ],
  
  chromeRecorderIntegration: {
    recordingMode: "intelligent", // AI-enhanced recording
    executionMode: "autonomous", // Self-healing workflows
    errorHandling: "adaptive", // Learn from failures
    
    workflowTemplates: [
      "lead_capture_automation",
      "user_onboarding_flows",
      "content_updates",
      "analytics_collection", 
      "support_ticket_processing"

  },
  
  costOptimization: {
    provider: "akash-first",
    fallback: "openai-minimal",
    budgetAlert: "5-dollars-daily"
  }
};
```

### Automated RPA Workflow Creation
```bash
# Create RPA workflows for each app
for app in "${APPS[@]}"; do
  echo "Setting up RPA for $app..."
  
  # Record basic user journeys
  @chrome-recorder record-workflow $app \
    --flows "welcome,signup,main-feature-demo" \
    --enhance-with-ai \

```

## Phase 6: Pay-What-You-Can Monetization

### Universal Payment Integration
```typescript
// PWYC Payment System
export const payWhatYouCanConfig = {
  provider: "stripe", // Most flexible for PWYC
  
  pricingModel: {
    suggested: [5, 15, 50], // Monthly suggestions
    minimum: 0, // Truly free option
    custom: true, // User can enter any amount
    
    valueProposition: {
      free: "Full access with community support",
      supporter: "Priority support + exclusive updates", 
      champion: "Direct access to founder + early features"
    }
  },
  
  integrationPoints: {
    apps: "All 371 Minds apps",
    agents: "Enhanced AI agent capabilities for supporters",
    community: "Special Status.app channels for contributors",
    rpa: "Advanced automation workflows for champions"
  },
  
  transparency: {
    showCostBreakdown: true, // "Your $5 covers hosting for 50 users"
    showImpact: true, // "Thanks to supporters, 1000 users access this free"
    showRoadmap: true // "Next month's revenue goal: $500 for feature X"
  }
};
```
