```

### **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers**
371 OS includes several MCP server configurations for enhanced context awareness:

- **GitHub MCP**: Access to repository data and issues
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation capabilities
- **Slack MCP**: Team communication integration
- **Google Drive MCP**: Document and file access
- **Context7 MCP**: Upstash-powered context storage
- **Cognition Layer MCP**: Real-time cognitive state awareness
- **Puter MCP**: Integrated cloud storage, AI, and hosting capabilities

For details on configuring and using these MCP servers, see the [mcp/](./mcp/) directory.

### **Core Libraries Structure**
The 371 OS project follows a well-organized Nx workspace structure with dedicated core libraries and unified agent architecture:

```
os-workspace/
├── apps/                           # Applications
│   ├── cognitive-interface/        # Cognitive-aware UI system
│   └── chief-of-staff-agent/      # Ortega - Strategic orchestration
├── agents/                         # Agent configurations (legacy)
├── packages/                       # ElizaOS plugins and other packages
├── libs/                          # Core shared libraries
│   ├── blockchain-registry/        # Blockchain-based agent coordination
│   ├── ipfs-storage/              # Decentralized storage implementation
│   ├── core-types/                # Shared TypeScript interfaces
│   └── prompts/                   # Centralized agent definitions
│       └── agent-definitions/      # Agent "brains" (YAML definitions)
└── tools/                         # Development and deployment scripts
```

These core libraries provide foundational capabilities:

1. **blockchain-registry**: Provides blockchain-based agent coordination and discovery capabilities
2. **ipfs-storage**: Implements decentralized storage using IPFS
3. **core-types**: Contains shared TypeScript interfaces used across multiple packages
4. **prompts**: Centralized agent definitions following the unified architecture
   - **agent-definitions/**: Agent "brains" stored as YAML files (e.g., Ortega Chief of Staff)
   - Separates agent logic from execution runtime for better maintainability

Each library is fully integrated with the Nx workspace and follows the 371 OS architecture principles of decentralization, modularity, and reusability.

In addition to the core workspace, the project includes specialized implementations:

```
questflow/
├── dev-team/               # Internal development team tools and support
└── ...                     # Other QuestFlow components
```

The `dev-team/` directory contains internal tooling and development support for the QuestFlow platform implementation, including agent development frameworks, spec-driven development workflows, and deployment automation tools.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### **Dependency Optimization**

We've significantly reduced our dependency count by replacing heavy toolchains with faster, single-binary alternatives:

- **Biome Migration**: Replaced ESLint + Prettier with Biome for linting and formatting
  - Reduced dependency count from 2200+ to a much more manageable number
  - Significantly faster execution
  - Simplified configuration with a single tool

- **Jest Migration**: Replaced Jest with Bun's built-in test runner
  - Eliminated Jest and related dependencies
  - Orders of magnitude faster test execution
  - Simplified test configuration

- **Runtime Migration**: Replaced nodemon and ts-node with Bun's built-in watcher
  - Eliminated runtime dependencies
  - Faster hot reloading
  - Simplified runtime configuration

## ☁️ Puter.js Integration

371 OS now includes integrated support for Puter.js, providing serverless cloud infrastructure, AI capabilities, and hosting services.

### **Key Features**

- **☁️ Cloud Storage**: File system operations with `puter.fs`
- **🤖 AI Integration**: Access to Claude, GPT, Gemini, and other models through `puter.ai`
- **🗄️ Key-Value Store**: Simple NoSQL database with `puter.kv`
- **🌐 Hosting**: Static website deployment with `puter.hosting`
- **🔐 Authentication**: Secure user authentication with `puter.auth`
- **💰 User Pays Model**: Users cover their own cloud and AI usage costs

### **Quick Start with Puter.js**

```html
<!-- Simple example using Puter.js AI and storage -->
<html>
<body>
    <script src="https://js.puter.com/v2/"></script>
    <script>
        // Chat with AI
        puter.ai.chat(`What is life?`, { model: "gpt-5-nano" }).then(puter.print);
        
        // Save user preference
        puter.kv.set('userPreference', 'darkMode').then(() => {
            puter.print('Preference saved!');
        });
        
        // Create a file
        puter.fs.write('hello.txt', 'Hello, world!').then((file) => {
            puter.print(`File created at: ${file.path}`);
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### **Advanced AI Capabilities**

```javascript
// Image generation
puter.ai.txt2img('A picture of a cat').then((image) => {
    document.body.appendChild(image);
});

// OCR (Image to Text)
puter.ai.img2txt('https://example.com/image.png').then(puter.print);

// Text to Speech
puter.ai.txt2speech('Hello world!').then((audio) => {
    audio.play();
});
```

### **File Operations**

```javascript
// Write a file
puter.fs.write('document.txt', 'Hello, Puter!');

// Read a file
puter.fs.read('document.txt').then(blob => blob.text()).then(content => {
    console.log(content);
});

// Create a directory
puter.fs.mkdir('my-folder');

// List directory contents
puter.fs.readdir('./').then(items => {
    console.log(items);
});
```

### **Deployment**

```javascript
// Deploy a static website
(async () => {
    // Create a directory
    let dir = await puter.fs.mkdir('my-website');
    
    // Create index.html
    await puter.fs.write(`${dir.name}/index.html`, '<h1>Hello, Puter!</h1>');
    
    // Deploy the website
    let subdomain = puter.randName();
    const site = await puter.hosting.create(subdomain, dir.name);
    
    console.log(`Website deployed at: https://${site.subdomain}.puter.site`);
})();
```
