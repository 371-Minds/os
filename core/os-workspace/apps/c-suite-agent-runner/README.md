# C-Suite Agent Runner

**🎆 AGENT FACTORY PLAN IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Step 1 ✅**

The C-Suite Agent Runner is a standalone, productized runtime for C-Suite agents implementing the NexeCompatibleAgent blueprint and integrating ElizaOS character definitions. This application moves C-Suite agents from simulation into real business application deployment.

## 🚀 Implementation Overview

This application fulfills **Step 1** of the Agent Factory Plan:

> **Step 1: Create the Standalone c-suite-agent-runner Application**
> 
> We will create a new, dedicated application that serves as the primary, productized runtime for our C-Suite agents.

### ✅ Implementation Achievements

## 🔄 Next Steps: Step 2 Implementation

With Step 1 complete, the next phase implements **Step 2**:

> **Step 2: Evolve the agent-factory's Role**
> 
> The role of the agent-factory will now be upgraded to that of a true "factory."
> The factory's primary responsibility will now be to build and package instances of the c-suite-agent-runner application.

### Step 2 Achievements ✅
