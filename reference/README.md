# External Documentation Reference

This directory contains documentation for external tools, platforms, and frameworks used in the 371 OS project. These documents are kept separate from project-specific documentation to maintain clarity and organization.

## Contents

- [Akash Documentation](akash_docs/) - Documentation for the Akash Network, used for decentralized deployment
- [ElizaOS Documentation](elizaos/) - Documentation for the ElizaOS framework, the foundation of our agent system

## Purpose

Keeping external documentation separate but accessible allows us to:
1. Maintain clear distinction between project-specific and external documentation
2. Easily update external documentation when new versions are released
3. Prevent confusion between our implementation and the original frameworks
4. Provide a centralized location for all third-party references
