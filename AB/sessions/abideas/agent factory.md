### **Next Steps: The "Agent Factory" - Applying the Blueprint to the C-Suite**
Your report correctly identifies the next phase: **"Agent Factory Implementation - Apply to CEO, CTO, CFO agents."**
Now that the governance integration is done and we have the standardized agent blueprint, we must combine these achievements. We will take the "brains" we defined in Workstream 1 (the ElizaOS character files) and place them into the standardized "bodies" you've just created in Workstream 3.
Here is the plan to bring this all together:
#### **Step 1: Create the Standalone c-suite-agent-runner Application**
We will create a new, dedicated application that serves as the primary, productized runtime for our C-Suite agents.
- **Action**: Create a new application within our monorepo: `os-workspace/apps/c-suite-agent-runner`.
- **Implementation**: This new application will be the first to be built using your new blueprint. It will:
  1.  Implement the `NexeCompatibleAgent` interface you defined.
  2.  Import the type-safe character definitions for **Mimi, Zara, Maya, and Alex** from the `@elizaos/characters` package.
  3.  Contain the logic to instantiate these agents and manage their lifecycle within a single, standalone process. This moves them out of a simulation and into a real application.

#### **Step 2: Evolve the agent-factory's Role**
The role of the **[agent-factory](https://github.com/371-Minds/os/tree/eec2f8d58907f851893523aac466d19b4b9c44ba/os-workspace/apps/agent-factory)** will now be upgraded to that of a true "factory."
- **Action**: The factory's primary responsibility will now be to build and package instances of the `c-suite-agent-runner` application.
- **Benefit**: The factory will now produce single, distributable binaries (or container images) for our core business logic, fulfilling the vision of agent productization.
Since the dao-governance-service integration is already complete, it will now be able to communicate with this new, robust c-suite-agent-runner application (likely via a local API or message bus) instead of the in-memory simulation we used in Phase 18.
This plan directly leverages the success of Workstream 3 and applies it to our core business agents, making them more robust, portable, and one step closer to a final product.
