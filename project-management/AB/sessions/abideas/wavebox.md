## 1. **What is Wavebox and Why Use It for 371OS?**

Wavebox is a next-gen Chromium-based productivity browser designed to organize all your web apps, workflows, and extensions in one place. It's especially powerful for teams building modular, plugin-based, or agentic systems—like 371OS—because it:

- Lets you group and manage all your SaaS tools, dashboards, and dev environments in one UI.
- Supports Chrome extensions, custom integrations, and automation.
- Offers advanced tab/session management, multi-account support, and analytics dashboards.
- Has an open extension API and automation hooks (including for AI agents).

## 2. **Key Use Cases for 371OS**

### **A. Unified Workspace for 371OS Development & Operations**

- **Group all 371OS tools:** GitHub, documentation, Notion, project management, CI/CD dashboards, and your own 371OS web UIs as sidebar apps.
- **Stay signed in to multiple accounts:** Useful for dev, staging, and production environments.
- **Split-screen and multi-profile:** Run multiple 371OS instances or user roles side-by-side.

### **B. Plugin & Agent Development**

- **Test browser-based plugins/extensions:** Wavebox supports Chrome extensions and has its own [extension API](https://github.com/wavebox/wavebox-lO-extension-api).
- **Automate workflows:** Use the [wavebox-browser-control-mcp](https://github.com/wavebox/wavebox-browser-control-mcp) extension to script browser actions, automate testing, or integrate with AI agents (e.g., Claude, Gemini).
    - *Note: This feature requires macOS. Windows users should refer to [wavebox-universal-mcp-windows.md](wavebox-universal-mcp-windows.md)*
- **Integrate with 371OS agentic workflows:** Launch, monitor, and control browser-based agents or dashboards from within Wavebox.

### **C. Analytics & Dashboards**

- **Centralize analytics:** Pin your 371OS analytics dashboards (Metabase, Tableau, custom UIs) as apps for always-on monitoring.
- **Admin dashboards:** Use Wavebox's built-in dashboard features to visualize plugin usage, user journeys, and engagement (see [Wavebox Analytics Features](https://wavebox.io/features)).

### **D. Documentation & Knowledge Management**

- **Pin docs and Notebooks:** Keep 371OS documentation, Warp Notebooks, and knowledge bases (e.g., Notion, Confluence) as sidebar apps for instant access.
- **Smart notes & tab sessions:** Use Wavebox's note-taking and session-saving features to document workflows and share with your team.

---

## 3. **Advanced: Automation & AI Integration**

- **Browser Automation:** Use [wavebox-browser-control-mcp](https://github.com/wavebox/wavebox-browser-control-mcp) to let AI agents (like Claude or your own 371OS agents) control Wavebox—open tabs, scrape data, run tests, etc.
    - *Requirements: macOS, Node.js, enable AppleScript in Wavebox.*
    - *Note: Windows users should refer to [wavebox-universal-mcp-windows.md](wavebox-universal-mcp-windows.md) for cross-platform alternatives*
- **Custom Extensions:** Build 371OS-specific browser extensions for workflow shortcuts, data collection, or agent triggers.
- **Event Tracking:** Implement event tracking in both web and plugin environments, centralizing analytics for adaptive content and recommendations (see your previous analytics blueprint).

## 4. **How to Set Up Wavebox for 371OS**

### **Step-by-Step**

1. **Download & Install Wavebox**
   - [Download for your OS](https://wavebox.io/download)
   - Start with the 7-day Pro trial (no credit card needed).

2. **Set Up Your 371OS Workspace**
   - Add all your core web apps (GitHub, Notion, CI/CD, 371OS dashboards) as sidebar apps.
   - Organize apps into groups (e.g., "Dev", "Ops", "Docs", "Agents").

3. **Install Extensions**
   - Add Chrome extensions you use for 371OS development.
   - (Optional) Install [wavebox-browser-control-mcp](https://github.com/wavebox/wavebox-browser-control-mcp) for automation.
      - *Note: This extension is macOS-only. Windows users should refer to [wavebox-universal-mcp-windows.md](wavebox-universal-mcp-windows.md)*

4. **Configure Profiles & Sessions**
   - Set up multiple profiles for different 371OS environments or user roles.
   - Use tab/session management to save and restore complex workflows.

5. **Pin Dashboards & Notebooks**
   - Add analytics dashboards, Warp Notebooks, and documentation as always-on apps.

6. **(Optional) Develop Custom Integrations**
   - Use the [Wavebox Extension API](https://github.com/wavebox/wavebox-lO-extension-api) to build custom 371OS plugins.
   - Integrate with your 371OS analytics/event tracking backend.

## 5. **Example: Using Wavebox for 371OS Agentic Workflows**

- **Scenario:** You want to monitor 371OS deployments, run browser-based tests, and trigger agent workflows from a single interface.
    - Pin your 371OS dashboard, CI/CD, and logs as sidebar apps.
    - Use the browser-control extension to let your AI agent open tabs, check deployment status, and report results.
       - *Note: This example uses macOS-specific features. Windows users should refer to [wavebox-universal-mcp-windows.md](wavebox-universal-mcp-windows.md)*
    - Save tab sessions for different projects or clients.
    - Use Wavebox's analytics to see which workflows are most used and where users drop off.

## 6. **Security & Privacy**

- Wavebox is ad/tracking-free and supports multiple isolated cookie containers.
- You control what extensions and automations are enabled.
- For sensitive automation (e.g., browser-control-mcp), only enable on trusted machines.
