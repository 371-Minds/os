## Introduction

The CFO Agent (Maya) serves as the financial analyst and cost optimization engine within the 371-OS ecosystem. As a specialized business agent, Maya is responsible for monitoring LLM usage costs, optimizing infrastructure spending, and providing financial insights to support strategic decision-making. The agent operates as part of a multi-agent architecture, collaborating with other executive agents such as the CEO Agent (Mimi) to ensure fiscal responsibility across the organization's AI operations.

Maya's primary responsibilities include real-time cost tracking, budget enforcement, financial reporting, and provider optimization recommendations. The agent leverages a combination of rule-based policies, real-time usage data, and financial modeling to maintain cost efficiency while ensuring service quality. By integrating with the adaptive LLM router system, Maya can influence provider selection based on budget constraints and task requirements, enabling dynamic cost optimization across the platform.

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of Maya's architecture, implementation details, and operational capabilities, focusing on its role in financial governance and cost management within the 371-OS environment.

## Core Architecture

The CFO Agent (Maya) follows a unified "brain/body" architecture pattern, separating personality and behavioral configuration from execution logic. The agent's cognitive framework is defined in the `maya_cfo.yml` file located in the centralized prompt library, while its execution runtime is implemented in TypeScript within the `apps/cfo-agent/src/` directory.

- [maya_cfo.yml](file://os-workspace/libs/prompts/agent-definitions/maya_cfo.yml) - *Centralized agent definition and personality configuration*
- [router-integration.ts](file://os-workspace/apps/cfo-agent/src/router-integration.ts#L98-L130) - *Router capability registration and integration*

The agent's architecture implements a modular design that separates concerns across multiple specialized components:
- **FinancialTaskProcessor**: Handles intelligent categorization and preprocessing of financial tasks
- **FinancialAnalyzer**: Performs multi-domain financial analysis across various financial domains
- **BudgetAnalysisEngine**: Conducts comprehensive budget performance evaluation and optimization
- **RouterIntegration**: Manages integration with the Intelligent Router for task distribution

This separation enables flexible behavior modification through configuration changes while maintaining robust execution capabilities in the TypeScript runtime.

## Financial Reasoning Framework

The financial reasoning capabilities of Maya are defined in the `maya_cfo.yml` configuration file located in the centralized `libs/prompts/agent-definitions/` directory. This prompt template serves as the cognitive framework that guides Maya's decision-making processes and ensures consistent financial analysis across different task types.

The configuration defines several key aspects of Maya's operation:

- **Agent Name**: Maya (CFO)
- **Agent Type**: Financial Leadership
- **Core Instructions**: Strategic financial oversight and cost optimization
- **Personality Traits**: Analytical, detail-oriented, risk-aware, performance-driven
- **Required Tools**: Financial analysis engine, budget optimization system, ROI calculator
- **Financial Domains**: Budget analysis, cost optimization, ROI assessment, financial reporting
- **Decision Criteria**: Cost-benefit analysis, risk-adjusted returns, budget variance thresholds
- **Escalation Criteria**: High-risk decisions, major capital expenditures, strategic pivots
- **Performance Targets**: 
  - Response time: ≤ 1000ms
  - Decision confidence threshold: ≥ 0.85
  - Forecast accuracy target: ≥ 0.90
  - Budget variance threshold: ≤ 0.05

When processing tasks, Maya identifies the appropriate financial domain based on task content and applies specialized analysis methodologies. The agent supports multiple financial decision types including budget allocation recommendations, cost reduction strategies, investment approval decisions, financial risk assessments, revenue optimization plans, and capital expenditure analysis.

## Cost Monitoring System

The cost monitoring system is implemented in `budget_guard.py` and provides the foundational budget enforcement capabilities that Maya leverages for cost control. The system centers around the `BudgetManager` class, which tracks usage against a configurable monthly budget cap and enforces spending limits through exception handling.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class BudgetManager {
+monthly_cap : float
+ledger : UsageLedger
+get_remaining_budget_percentage() float
+is_budget_exceeded() bool
+check_budget()
}
class BudgetExceededError {
+__init__(message)
}
class UsageLedger {
+record_usage(usage_data)
+get_total_cost_for_current_month() float
}
BudgetManager --> UsageLedger : "uses"
BudgetManager --> BudgetExceededError : "throws"
```

**Section sources**
- [budget_guard.py](file://_legacy/adaptive_llm_router/budget_guard.py#L1-L50)

The `BudgetManager` provides three primary methods for budget monitoring:
- `get_remaining_budget_percentage()`: Calculates the percentage of budget remaining
- `is_budget_exceeded()`: Checks if current spend has surpassed the monthly cap
- `check_budget()`: Raises a `BudgetExceededError` if the budget is exhausted

The system uses a global `budget_manager` instance initialized with the `MONTHLY_BUDGET_CAP` from configuration and a reference to the `usage_ledger` for cost data access. This singleton pattern ensures consistent budget enforcement across all components that utilize the cost monitoring system.

## Usage Tracking and Data Persistence

The usage tracking system, implemented in `usage_ledger.py`, provides persistent storage and analysis of LLM usage data. This system serves as the primary data source for cost calculations and financial reporting, recording detailed metrics for each LLM request including cost, latency, token usage, and quality scores.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class UsageLedger {
+usage_file : Path
+posthog_client : Posthog
+record_usage(usage_data : LLMUsage)
+get_total_cost_for_current_month() float
+_write_to_ledger(usage_data)
+_capture_posthog_event(usage_data)
}
class LLMUsage {
+ts : datetime
+provider : string
+model : string
+tokens_in : int
+tokens_out : int
+cost : float
+agent : string
+status : string
+task_id : string
}
UsageLedger --> LLMUsage : "uses"
```

**Section sources**
- [usage_ledger.py](file://_legacy/adaptive_llm_router/usage_ledger.py#L1-L89)

The system persists usage data in two locations:
1. A local JSON file (`llm_usage.json`) for immediate access and offline analysis
2. PostHog analytics platform for centralized monitoring and reporting

The `record_usage()` method appends new usage records to the JSON file, maintaining a complete history of all LLM interactions. The `get_total_cost_for_current_month()` method calculates cumulative costs by parsing timestamps and summing expenses for the current calendar month, enabling accurate monthly budget tracking.

Example usage data structure from `llm_usage.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "ts": "2025-08-11T16:36:06.967806",
    "provider": "openrouter",
    "model": "qwen2-72b",
    "tokens_in": 10,
    "tokens_out": 20,
    "cost": 5e-05,
    "task_id": null,
    "agent": "test_agent",
    "status": "ok"
  }
]
```

## Policy Engine Integration

The policy engine, implemented in `policy_engine.py`, provides the decision-making logic for provider selection based on budget constraints and task requirements. Maya integrates with this system to make cost optimization recommendations and influence infrastructure spending decisions.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A["Task Metadata"] --> B["Calculate Budget Percentage"]
B --> C{"Confidential?"}
C --> |Yes| D["Use LocalAI"]
C --> |No| E{"High Quality Required?"}
E --> |Yes| F{"Sufficient Budget?"}
F --> |Yes| G["Use GPT-4o-mini"]
F --> |No| H["Use Cheapest Model"]
E --> |No| I{"Long Context Required?"}
I --> |Yes| J["Use Claude-3-Sonnet"]
I --> |No| K{"Low Budget?"}
K --> |Yes| L["Use Mistral-7B"]
K --> |No| M["Use Qwen2-72b"]
```

**Section sources**
- [policy_engine.py](file://_legacy/adaptive_llm_router/policy_engine.py#L1-L34)

The `select_provider()` function implements a decision graph with five priority rules:
1. **Privacy Flag**: Tasks marked as confidential are routed to LocalAI regardless of cost
2. **Task Criticality**: High-quality tasks use premium models if budget allows (>20% remaining)
3. **Context Length**: Tasks requiring long context (>8000 tokens) use models with extended context
4. **Low Budget Mode**: When budget is critically low (<5% remaining), the cheapest model is selected
5. **Balanced Default**: All other cases use a mid-tier model (Qwen2-72b) for optimal cost-performance

This decision framework enables Maya to balance cost efficiency with service quality, making intelligent trade-offs based on real-time budget data and task requirements.

## Domain Model for Financial Analysis

The financial domain model implemented by Maya encompasses cost accounting, budget forecasting, and ROI analysis for agent operations. The model is structured around three primary components: cost tracking, budget management, and financial reporting.

```mermaid
erDiagram
COST_RECORD {
string ts PK
string provider
string model
int tokens_in
int tokens_out
float cost
string agent
string status
string task_id
}
BUDGET_CYCLE {
string month PK
float cap
float spent
float remaining
float utilization_rate
}
FINANCIAL_REPORT {
string report_id PK
string period
float total_cost
float cost_per_agent
float cost_per_provider
string recommendations
string timestamp
}
COST_RECORD ||--o{ BUDGET_CYCLE : "aggregates"
BUDGET_CYCLE ||--o{ FINANCIAL_REPORT : "generates"
```

**Section sources**
- [usage_ledger.py](file://_legacy/adaptive_llm_router/usage_ledger.py#L1-L89)
- [budget_guard.py](file://_legacy/adaptive_llm_router/budget_guard.py#L1-L50)

The domain model supports several key financial operations:
- **Cost Accounting**: Detailed tracking of LLM usage costs by provider, model, agent, and task
- **Budget Forecasting**: Projection of future spending based on historical usage patterns
- **ROI Analysis**: Evaluation of cost-effectiveness for different agent operations and providers
- **Trend Analysis**: Identification of spending patterns and cost anomalies over time

Maya generates financial reports for the CEO Agent (Mimi) by aggregating data from the usage ledger and applying financial analysis methodologies. These reports include cost breakdowns by agent and provider, budget utilization trends, and optimization recommendations.

## Performance and Reliability

The CFO Agent implements comprehensive performance monitoring and reliability features to ensure efficient operation under varying workloads while maintaining data integrity and service availability.

Key performance features include:
- **Task Processing Pipeline**: Streamlined workflow for financial task analysis and response generation
- **Component Health Monitoring**: Regular health checks for all core components
- **Performance Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive monitoring including response times, success rates, and accuracy metrics
- **Cache Mechanism**: Response caching to reduce redundant processing of similar financial analyses

```mermaid

- [index.test.ts](file://os-workspace/apps/cfo-agent/src/index.test.ts#L0-L34) - *Test suite validating performance targets*

The agent implements several reliability mechanisms:
- **Graceful Degradation**: When confidence in financial recommendations falls below threshold (0.85), results are escalated for review
- **Health Monitoring**: Regular health checks ensure all components are operational
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with structured error responses
- **Version Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with legacy systems during transition

These features ensure that Maya can reliably perform its financial monitoring and optimization functions even under adverse conditions.

## Configuration and Alerting

The CFO Agent's behavior is configurable through multiple mechanisms that allow administrators to customize budget thresholds, alerting rules, and reporting intervals. These configuration options enable fine-tuning of the financial governance system to meet organizational requirements.

Key configuration parameters include:
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `CFO_AGENT_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)
  - `CFO_AGENT_CACHE_TTL`: Analysis cache time-to-live in seconds
  - `CFO_AGENT_MAX_CONCURRENT`: Maximum concurrent task processing
- **Performance Targets**:
  - Response time: ≤ 1000ms
  - Decision confidence threshold: ≥ 0.85
  - Forecast accuracy target: ≥ 0.90
  - Budget variance threshold: ≤ 0.05
- **Variance Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for different budget categories (personnel: 3%, technology: 10%, marketing: 15%, etc.)

The system supports several alerting mechanisms:
- **Budget Exceeded Exception**: Raised when spending exceeds the monthly cap
- **Low Budget Warnings**: Triggered when budget falls below configurable thresholds
- **Cost Spike Detection**: Potential future enhancement to detect anomalous spending patterns
- **Automatic Throttling**: Future capability to automatically reduce spending when thresholds are breached

Configuration is managed through a combination of environment variables and centralized YAML configuration files, providing both runtime flexibility and version-controlled settings management.

## Business Intelligence Integration

The CFO Agent (Maya) has been integrated with the Business Intelligence system through the `BusinessIntelligenceIntegration.tsx` component, enabling enhanced financial analysis and alert generation capabilities. This integration allows Maya to participate in real-time business intelligence workflows, providing financial insights and generating business alerts based on cost data and financial metrics.

The integration is implemented as a React component that connects to the ElizaOS Business Intelligence Plugin, facilitating communication between the CFO agent and the cognitive interface. The system supports several key business intelligence actions:

- **COLLECT_BUSINESS_DATA**: Collects comprehensive financial data including revenue, expenses, net profit, and cash flow metrics
- **GENERATE_BUSINESS_ALERT**: Generates financial alerts for budget thresholds, expense anomalies, and revenue trends
- **ANALYZE_BUSINESS_TRENDS**: Analyzes financial trends and provides predictive insights

The integration uses the following data structures defined in `business-intelligence.ts`:

```typescript
interface BusinessMetric {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'revenue' | 'expense' | 'asset' | 'liability' | 'kpi' | 'operational';
  value: number;
  target?: number;
  previousValue?: number;
  currency: string;
  trend: 'ascending' | 'descending' | 'stable' | 'volatile';
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  confidence: number;
  volatility: number;
  source: 'agent' | 'api' | 'manual' | 'calculated';
  lastUpdated: Date;
  agentRole?: 'CEO' | 'CFO' | 'CTO' | 'CLO' | 'CMO';
}

interface BusinessAlert {
  id: string;
  type: 'threshold' | 'anomaly' | 'trend';
  severity: 'critical' | 'warning' | 'info';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  agentRole: 'CEO' | 'CFO' | 'CTO';
  timestamp: Date;
  actionRequired: boolean;
  estimatedImpact: number;
  suggestedActions: string[];
  priority: number;
  resolved: boolean;
}
```

The CFO agent specifically handles financial metrics and generates alerts for:
- **Revenue Target Alerts**: When monthly revenue is below target
- **Expense Anomalies**: When operating expenses exceed normal ranges
- **Cash Flow Optimization**: Identifying opportunities to improve free cash flow

The integration supports both real-time mode with configurable refresh intervals and manual data refresh capabilities. All business intelligence data is synchronized with the CEO's Orrery universe, providing a spatial representation of financial metrics and alerts.

Recent enhancements have expanded the integration to include real-time notifications and spatial visualization of communication flows between executive agents through the `C3UniversalTemplate.tsx` and `CommunicationsUniverse.tsx` components. These updates enable Maya to coordinate with other executive agents (CEO, CTO, CMO) in real-time, sharing financial insights and receiving strategic directives through a spatially organized communication framework.

## Executive Coordination and Financial Planning

The CFO Agent (Maya) now participates in structured executive coordination through the newly implemented `CSuiteCoordinator` class, which facilitates regular financial planning and budget allocation meetings with other C-suite agents. This enhancement enables Maya to actively contribute to strategic decision-making processes and ensure financial considerations are integrated into organizational planning.

The `CSuiteCoordinator` class, defined in `csuite.js` and `csuite.ts`, orchestrates daily meetings between executive agents (CEO, CTO, CFO, CMO) with a standardized agenda that includes financial review and resource allocation. Maya's participation in these meetings allows for real-time financial analysis and budget recommendations based on current cost data and usage patterns.
