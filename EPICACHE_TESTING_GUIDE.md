## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Memory Management Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check port availability
netstat -an | grep 39302

# Kill existing processes
npx kill-port 39302

# Restart server
node f:/os-main/mcp/memory-management-mcp-server.js
```

#### Episode Clustering Fails
```bash
# Check episode creation
curl http://localhost:39302/episodes/stats

# Test with sample data
curl -X POST http://localhost:39302/episodes/cluster \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId": "CEO_Mimi", "conversations": [{"id": "test", "content": "Strategic planning discussion"}]}'
```

#### Low Compression Ratios
1. **Verify Episode Types**: Ensure conversations are properly categorized
2. **Check Memory Budgets**: Validate agent-specific budget allocation
3. **Review Clustering**: Check semantic clustering quality

#### SSE Connection Issues
```bash
# Test cognition server SSE
curl -s http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse

# Check for memory events
curl http://localhost:39300/memory/stats
```
