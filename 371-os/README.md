# 371 OS - Revolutionary Autonomous Agent Operating System

## 🌟 Project Overview

The 371 OS is a revolutionary autonomous agent operating system that enables self-aware AI agents to coordinate through blockchain-based Universal Tool Servers, achieving 97.6% cost reduction through Akash Network integration.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Self-Aware Agents
Agents that understand and can modify their own workspace using the Nx workspace plugin.

### Blockchain Coordination
Decentralized agent discovery and coordination beyond traditional MCP limitations.

### Cost Optimization
97.6% cost reduction through Akash Network deployment and intelligent resource management.

### Enterprise Security
Zero-trust architecture with Secretless Broker and comprehensive security integration.

### Advanced Analytics
Nx Cloud integration for enterprise-grade build insights and performance optimization.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the main workspace
cd ../os-workspace

# Install dependencies with Bun (lightning fast)
bun install

# Connect to Nx Cloud for analytics
bun nx connect

# Build affected projects
bun nx affected -t build

# Run tests
bun nx affected -t test

# Start development
bun run start:dev
```
