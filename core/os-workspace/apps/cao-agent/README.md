## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Performance Monitoring Issues
```typescript
// Issue: Performance data not updating
// Solution: Check agent registration and data flow
const metrics = cao.performanceMonitor.getRealTimeMetrics();
if (metrics.total_agents_monitored === 0) {
  console.log('No agents registered for monitoring');
  // Re-register agents or check data pipeline
}
```

#### Curriculum Delivery Issues
```typescript
// Issue: Curriculum not being delivered
// Solution: Verify curriculum exists and agent eligibility
const curriculum = cao.curriculumManager.getCurriculum('curriculum_id');
if (!curriculum) {
  console.log('Curriculum not found');
  // Create curriculum or check curriculum ID
}
```

#### Assessment Issues
```typescript
// Issue: Assessment evaluation failing
// Solution: Validate response format and question mapping
try {
  const result = await cao.assessmentAnalyzer.evaluateAgentCompetencies(
    agentId, assessmentId, responses
  );
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Assessment evaluation failed:', error.message);
  // Check response format and question IDs
}
```

### Error Codes

| Code | Description | Resolution |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ERROR` | Performance data tracking failed | Verify agent ID and data format |
| `CURRICULUM_DESIGN_ERROR` | Curriculum creation failed | Check performance data completeness |
| `COMPETENCY_EVALUATION_ERROR` | Assessment evaluation failed | Validate response format |
| `CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_ERROR` | Optimization process failed | Review strategy configuration |

### Health Check Diagnostics

```typescript
// Comprehensive health check
const health = await cao.healthCheck();

if (health.status !== 'healthy') {
  console.log('Component Issues:');
  Object.entries(health.componentStatus).forEach(([component, status]) => {
    if (status !== 'operational') {
      console.log(`- ${component}: ${status}`);
    }
  });
  
  console.log('System Metrics:');
  console.log(`- Memory Usage: ${health.systemMetrics.memoryUsage}MB`);
  console.log(`- CPU Usage: ${health.systemMetrics.cpuUsage * 100}%`);
  console.log(`- Error Rate: ${health.systemMetrics.errorRate * 100}%`);
}
```
