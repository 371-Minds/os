# Spec-Driven Project Plan

1. Project Overview

Project Name: [Your Idea’s Title]

Objective: Define the problem and the measurable outcomes.

Vision/Goal: High-level goal tied to business or user impact.

Scope: Features and functions captured as initial specifications.

2. Specification Foundation

Gather Requirements: Collect from stakeholders, research, and target users.

Define Specifications: Write structured, testable specs for each feature (e.g., using Gherkin, OpenAPI, JSON/YAML schemas).

Specification Repository: Store specs in version control (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

3. Project Phases & Timeline (SDD-aligned)
Phase	Key Activities	Deliverables	Timeline
Phase 1: Spec Authoring	Draft specs for core features, prioritize	Spec documents (requirements → acceptance criteria)	Week 1–2
Phase 2: Spec Review	Stakeholder + dev team validation, refine	Approved specifications	Week 3
Phase 3: Development (Spec-first)	Generate scaffolds, implement code against specs	MVP aligned with specs	Month 2–3
Phase 4: Automated Testing	Use specs as source for test cases (BDD, CI/CD integration)	Passing test suite linked to specs	Month 3–4
Phase 5: Pilot & Feedback	Validate with users, update specs where gaps appear	Revised specifications, user feedback	Month 4–5
Phase 6: Launch & Scale	Public release with monitoring tied to spec compliance	Launch report, monitoring dashboards	Month 5+
4. Resources Needed

Spec Management Tools: Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman, Cucumber/Gherkin, or AsyncAPI.

Automation Tools: CI/CD pipelines to validate code against specs.

Team Roles:

Spec Author (often PM/BA + dev input)

Developer (implements against specs)

Tester/QA (ensures tests auto-generate from specs)

5. Risk Management

Risk: Specs drift from business needs → Mitigation: Continuous stakeholder review.

Risk: Overly rigid specs slow iteration → Mitigation: Start with minimal viable specs, refine incrementally.

Risk: Tooling complexity → Mitigation: Choose lightweight spec tools first.

6. Success Metrics

Spec Coverage: % of features with reviewed, testable specs.

Test Pass Rate: % of automated tests derived from specs passing.

Delivery Predictability: Features delivered on time vs. spec commitments.

User Acceptance: % of features meeting acceptance criteria.

7. Communication Plan

Weekly spec review meetings with stakeholders.

Specs tracked in repo pull requests/issues.

Automated test reports shared via CI/CD dashboard.
