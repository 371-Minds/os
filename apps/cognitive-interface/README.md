## 🌌 Galaxy Engine Prototype

### 📚 Reader's Constellation Demo

The Reader's Constellation demonstrates the revolutionary Galaxy Engine concept:

- **Books as Stars**: Each book becomes an interactive star in the reading universe
- **Genre Constellations**: Related books form visual constellations

- **Interactive Exploration**: Click, drag, and zoom through your knowledge universe

**Revolutionary Concept**: Traditional applications are flat, boring grids. Galaxy Engine transforms them into explorable universes where every element has depth, connection, and meaning.

## 🔌 ElizaOS Integration

### Cognitive Engine Plugin Bridge

```typescript
// Automatic cognitive state detection
const cognitiveState = await detectCognitiveState(userContext);

// Dynamic interface adaptation
if (cognitiveState.confidence > 85) {
  adaptInterface(cognitiveState.suggestedMode);
}

// Agent network coordination
await syncWithElizaOSAgents({
  mode: cognitiveState.mode,
  context: userContext,
  productivity: analyticsData
});
```

### Real-time Features
- **Context Analysis**: Analyzes user behavior patterns and app usage
- **Automatic Switching**: High-confidence automatic mode transitions
- **Agent Awareness**: ElizaOS agents adapt to current cognitive mode
- **Learning System**: Improves predictions based on user feedback

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Setup
```tsx
import { CognitiveInterface } from '@371minds/cognitive-interface';

function App() {
  return (
    <CognitiveInterface
      userId="your-user-id"
      enableAutoDetection={true}
      onStateChange={(state) => console.log('Cognitive state:', state)}
    />
  );
}
```

### With ElizaOS Integration
```tsx
import { EnhancedCognitiveInterface } from '@371minds/cognitive-interface';
import { cognitiveEnginePlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-cognitive-engine';

function EnhancedApp() {
  return (
    <EnhancedCognitiveInterface
      userId="your-user-id"
      cognitiveEnginePlugin={cognitiveEnginePlugin}
      enableAutoDetection={true}
    />
  );
}
```

### Galaxy Engine Universe
```tsx
import { ReadersConstellation } from '@371minds/cognitive-interface';

function ReadingApp() {
  return (
    <ReadersConstellation
      userId="reader-id"
      onBookSelect={(book) => console.log('Selected:', book.title)}
      onReadingProgress={(bookId, pages) => console.log('Progress:', pages)}
      onInsightCapture={(bookId, insight) => console.log('Insight:', insight)}
    />
