Extend Later

You can enhance this pipeline with:

Contract Validation → check code matches openapi.yaml
(using swagger-cli validate specs/openapi.yaml)

BDD Tests Execution → run cucumber-js on tasks.feature if you want direct Gherkin-based testing

Security Scans → npm audit or snyk integration

Nx build/test

Docker build/push to Docker Hub or GHCR

Akash deploy step (akash tx deployment update)
