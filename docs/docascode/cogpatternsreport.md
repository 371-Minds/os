# Weekly Cognitive Pattern & Project Status Analysis

Analyze my Pieces for Developers history from the last [7/14/30] days and provide:

## 1. Pattern Recognition Dashboard
- **Recurring Code Patterns**: What functions, libraries, or architectures am I repeatedly using?
- **Problem-Solving Patterns**: What types of technical challenges keep appearing?
- **Workflow Patterns**: What's my typical sequence of tools/technologies in a session?
- **Time-of-Day Patterns**: When am I most productive? When do I context-switch most?

## 2. Project Status Matrix
For each detected project stream:
- **Project Name/Theme**: Auto-identify from code context
- **Last Activity**: Date and type of work
- **Momentum Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Active | ðŸŸ¡ Stalled | ðŸ”´ Abandoned | âšª Dormant
- **Progress Indicators**: What milestones/features were completed?
- **Blockers Detected**: Repeated error messages, unresolved issues, stuck points
- **Next Logical Step**: Based on code evolution, what should I tackle next?

## 3. Cognitive State Analysis
- **Hyper-Focus Sessions**: Identify extended deep-work periods (1+ hour on single topic)
- **Context Switching Frequency**: How often am I jumping between projects?
- **Parallel Processing Detected**: Projects worked on simultaneously
- **Topic Drift vs. Productive Tangents**: Map unexpected but useful explorations
- **Cognitive Load Indicators**: Complexity spikes, error frequency increases

## 4. Technical Stack Evolution
- **New Technologies Adopted**: What did I learn/try this period?
- **Technology Abandonment**: What did I stop using and why?
- **Stack Consistency**: Am I maintaining focus on core tech or fragmenting?
- **Performance Optimization Opportunities**: Redundant code, outdated patterns

## 5. Knowledge Gaps & Learning Opportunities
- **Repeated Search Patterns**: What am I looking up multiple times?
- **Error Pattern Clusters**: Common mistakes indicating knowledge gaps
- **Unexplored Documentation**: Related topics I haven't investigated
- **Skill Development Trajectory**: What competencies are improving?

## 6. Optimization Recommendations
Based on detected patterns:
- **Workflow Accelerators**: Snippets, templates, or automation to create
- **Context Preservation**: Which project threads need documentation?
- **Priority Rebalancing**: Projects to focus/defer based on momentum
- **Tool Integration Opportunities**: Where automation could reduce friction
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Simplification opportunities

## 7. Economic Value Attribution
- **Sellable Assets Identified**: Reusable components, templates, patterns
- **Client/Project Value Generated**: Completed features, solved problems
- **Internal Token Earning Opportunities**: Innovations, optimizations achieved
- **Monetization Potential**: Which patterns could become products/services?

## Output Format Preferences
- Use visual hierarchy (emojis, headers, bullet points)
- Group related patterns together
- Highlight urgent items in **bold**
- Use status indicators: ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´âšª
- Provide actionable next steps, not just observations
- Keep technical depth appropriate for my expertise level

## Metadata to Analyze
- Code snippets and their context
- Search queries and documentation accessed
- Error messages and resolution attempts
- Timestamps and duration of work sessions
- Tags, annotations, and comments I've added
- Version control commit patterns (if available)
- Tool/IDE usage patterns
