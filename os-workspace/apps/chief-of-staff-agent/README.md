# Chief of Staff Agent (Ortega)

This agent serves as the bridge between high-level strategic intent and formal governance in the 371 DAO.

## Function

The Chief of Staff Agent (Ortega) transforms Stratplans from the `bizbuilderprompts` repository into formal DAO proposals in both Markdown and JSON formats.

## Agent Definition

The agent's "brain" is defined in the centralized prompt library:
[`libs/prompts/agent-definitions/ortega_chief_of_staff.yml`](file:///f:/os-main/os-workspace/libs/prompts/agent-definitions/ortega_chief_of_staff.yml)

## Usage

```bash
# Build the agent
nx build chief-of-staff-agent

# Run the agent
nx serve chief-of-staff-agent

# Test the agent
nx test chief-of-staff-agent
```

## Implementation Status

- [x] Agent "brain" created in centralized prompt library
- [x] Agent "body" created as Nx application
- [x] **Implement core logic to process Stratplans**
- [x] **Generate DAO proposals in Markdown and JSON formats**
- [x] **Connect to bizbuilderprompts repository (Phase 1 - Mock Implementation)**
- [x] **Core architecture and orchestration workflow**
- [x] **Comprehensive type definitions and interfaces**
- [x] **Test suite and validation framework**

### Phase 1 (COMPLETE) âœ…
- âœ… Core agent architecture and orchestration
- âœ… Stratplan analysis and processing engine
- âœ… DAO proposal generation (Markdown + JSON)
- âœ… Mock bizbuilderprompts integration
- âœ… File output and audit trail system
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite
- âœ… Health checks and validation

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- [ ] Real bizbuilderprompts repository integration
- [ ] YAML parsing and validation
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and recovery
- [ ] Integration with DAO governance platforms
- [ ] Blockchain registry coordination
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
