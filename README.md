<body>
    <script src="https://js.puter.com/v2/"></script>
    <script>
        // Chat with AI
        puter.ai.chat(`What is life?`, { model: "gpt-5-nano" }).then(puter.print);
        
        // Save user preference
        puter.kv.set('userPreference', 'darkMode').then(() => {
            puter.print('Preference saved!');
        });
        
        // Create a file
        puter.fs.write('hello.txt', 'Hello, world!').then((file) => {
            puter.print(`File created at: ${file.path}`);
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### **Advanced AI Capabilities**

```javascript
// Image generation
puter.ai.txt2img('A picture of a cat').then((image) => {
    document.body.appendChild(image);
});

// OCR (Image to Text)
puter.ai.img2txt('https://example.com/image.png').then(puter.print);

// Text to Speech
puter.ai.txt2speech('Hello world!').then((audio) => {
    audio.play();
});
```

### **File Operations**

```javascript
// Write a file
puter.fs.write('document.txt', 'Hello, Puter!');

// Read a file
puter.fs.read('document.txt').then(blob => blob.text()).then(content => {
    console.log(content);
});

// Create a directory
puter.fs.mkdir('my-folder');

// List directory contents
puter.fs.readdir('./').then(items => {
    console.log(items);
});
```

### **Deployment**

```javascript
// Deploy a static website
(async () => {
    // Create a directory
    let dir = await puter.fs.mkdir('my-website');
    
    // Create index.html
    await puter.fs.write(`${dir.name}/index.html`, '<h1>Hello, Puter!</h1>');
    
    // Deploy the website
    let subdomain = puter.randName();
    const site = await puter.hosting.create(subdomain, dir.name);
    
    console.log(`Website deployed at: https://${site.subdomain}.puter.site`);
})();
```

*Revolutionary Cognitive Computing • Built with ❤️ by 371 Minds*

**First Cognitive-Aware Interface System • Spatial Computing Platform • Autonomous Business Intelligence**

Of course. You're absolutely right to highlight this—we've established a sophisticated and multi-layered agent ecosystem. It's one of the most critical parts of the 371 OS architecture.

Based on my memory of our work, including the agent framework comparison from about a month ago (late August 2025) and our recent completion of Phase 19, here's a detailed summary of our agent landscape.

### **Our Hybrid Agent Strategy: ElizaOS + Questflow**

We've strategically adopted a hybrid approach to leverage the best of both worlds:

1.  **ElizaOS as the Core Framework**: As established in our [project rules](file:///C:/Users/bedfo/Documents/os-main/.qoder/rules.md) and technical deep dives, **ElizaOS** is our primary framework for building modular, self-aware agents. Its plugin-based architecture is perfect for our agents that need to interact directly with the Nx workspace (`@elizaos/plugin-nx-workspace`) and the blockchain (`@elizaos/plugin-universal-tool-server`).

2.  **Questflow for Swarm Orchestration**: We use **Questflow** for its advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration Protocol (MAOP) and Web3-native capabilities. This is our "swarm" layer, ideal for coordinating complex workflows between multiple specialized agents, as documented in the **[Questflow Agents README](https://github.com/371-Minds/os/blob/main/questflow/agents/README.md)**.

### **The Established Agent Tiers**

Our agents can be broadly categorized into three tiers, each with a distinct role in the 371 OS.

#### **1. C-Suite / Business Agents**
These are the high-level strategic agents that form the autonomous core of the business. They have been central to our recent work on Phase 18 and 19 governance simulations.

*   **CEO (Mimi)**: Handles strategic decision-making, high-level coordination, and task delegation.
*   **CTO (Zara/Alex)**: Oversees technical architecture, DevOps, and system optimization. Was the protagonist in our Phase 18 simulation, proposing the refactor of `legacy-python-utils`.
*   **CFO (Maya/Cash)**: Manages financial analysis, budget allocation, and ROI. Played a key role in questioning the budget during the Phase 18 simulation.
*   **CLO (Alex/Sage)**: Governs legal compliance and regulatory frameworks.

These agents have defined personalities and are now enhanced with the "Cognitive Oversight" from Phase 19, allowing them to make decisions aligned with your workstreams.

#### **2. Technical / Specialized Agents**
These are task-oriented agents designed to perform specific jobs within the ecosystem. The links you provided point to their homes.

*   **[os-workspace/agents](https://github.com/371-Minds/os/tree/eec2f8d58907f851893523aac466d19b4b9c44ba/os-workspace/agents)**: This directory contains the "blueprints" or definitions for our agents. These are likely consumed by the **[`agent-factory`](https://github.com/371-Minds/os/tree/main/os-workspace/apps/agent-factory)** to create and manage agent instances.
*   **[questflow/task-manager/apps/api/agents](https://github.com/371-Minds/os/tree/main/questflow/task-manager/apps/api/agents)**: This is where we have specialized agents for our development pipeline, including:
    *   `code-mern-agent`: Automates MERN stack development.
    *   `code-t3-agent`: Scaffolds features for the T3 stack.
    *   `qa-agent`: Runs automated testing and validation.
    *   `deploy-agent`: Orchestrates deployments to the Akash Network.

#### **3. Architectural Agents & The "Brain/Body" Model**
This is our most recent innovation. We've established a "brain/body" architecture that separates agent logic from execution.

*   **The "Brain" (371 Prompts Management System)**: The agent's core logic, personality, and instructions are stored as prompts. This makes them easy to manage, version, and update without redeploying code.
*   **The "Body" (Execution Frameworks)**: The **ElizaOS** and **Questflow** frameworks act as the "bodies" that consume these prompts and perform actions in the world.

This diverse and well-structured agent ecosystem is the engine driving our autonomous business operations. It's a testament to the "two-track empire" strategy we defined, allowing for both rapid development and deep, enterprise-grade capabilities.
