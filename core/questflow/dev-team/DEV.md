ðŸ“š Developer Guide â€“ Spec-Driven Nx + Akash System for QuestFlow Dev Team

**Note**: This guide covers the legacy QuestFlow dev-team workspace. For new agent development, consider using the 371 OS unified architecture with agent definitions in `../../os-workspace/libs/prompts/agent-definitions/` and implementations in `../../os-workspace/apps/`. See the [Chief of Staff Agent (Ortega)](../../os-workspace/apps/chief-of-staff-agent/) for an example.

1. Core Idea

This repo is spec-driven.
Everything starts from:

specs/openapi.yaml â†’ defines API contract.

specs/tasks.feature â†’ defines expected behaviors (BDD).

Agents (like code-mern, code-t3, qa, deploy) consume these specs to generate, test, or deploy code.

2. Repo Layout

  api/                # QuestFlow API (Express + MongoDB)

    code-t3/          # AI coder for T3 stack
    qa/               # QA agent (tests specs)
    deploy/           # Deploy agent (Akash deploys)

3. Agents
Code-MERN Agent

Reads: specs/openapi.yaml

Action: Generates MERN routes/tests.

Code-T3 Agent

Reads: specs/tasks.feature

Action: Generates T3 stack (Next.js/Prisma) features.

QA Agent

Reads: config.*, specs/openapi.yaml, specs/tasks.feature

Action: Runs tests:

Biome (unit tests for agents/libs, fast).

Bun Test + Supertest (integration tests for API).

Cucumber (executes tasks.feature).

Modes:

qaUseMocks: true â†’ uses mongo-mock.ts + akash-mock.ts.

qaUseMocks: false â†’ runs against live services.

Deploy Agent

Reads: config.*, docker/deploy.yaml, docker/profiles/*.yaml

Action:

If env=test â†’ simulate deploy (akash-mock.ts).

If env=staging â†’ real deploy with minimal profile.

If env=production â†’ real deploy with high profile.

4. Config System

All agents and API call loadConfig() from agents-core/config.ts.

Supported sources:

process.env

config.yaml / config.json

Environment-specific: config.test.yaml, config.staging.yaml, config.production.yaml

Validation:

Uses config.schema.json (Ajv).

Required: env + optional mongoUri, dbName, akashWallet, akashProfile.

Example config.staging.yaml
env: staging
mongoUri: mongodb://mongo:27017
dbName: questflow_staging
akashWallet: staging-wallet
akashProfile: minimal
qaUseMocks: false

5. Akash Profiles

Located in docker/profiles/.

minimal.yaml â†’ cheap staging (0.1 CPU, 0.25Gi RAM).

standard.yaml â†’ normal dev/prod (0.5 CPU, 1Gi RAM).

high.yaml â†’ production (2 CPU, 4Gi RAM).

Deploy Agent merges base deploy.yaml with the profile.

6. CI/CD Workflow
Pipeline Steps

Lint + Unit Tests â†’ bun nx run-many -t lint test --all

Integration Tests (API) â†’ bun nx test api

OpenAPI Validation â†’ bun swagger-cli validate specs/openapi.yaml

BDD Tests â†’ bun cucumber-js specs/tasks.feature --require tests/bdd

Deploy:

test â†’ Deploy Agent in mock mode.

staging â†’ Deploy Agent with minimal profile.

production â†’ Deploy Agent with high profile (manual approval required).

Deployment Promotion Flow

Test â†’ auto

Staging â†’ auto

Production â†’ requires GitHub approval (production environment protection).

7. Commands for Agents
Run API (dev)
NODE_ENV=development bun nx serve api

Run QA Agent (mock mode for CI)
QA_USE_MOCKS=true NODE_ENV=test bun nx serve qa-agent

Run Deploy Agent (staging)
NODE_ENV=staging bun nx serve deploy-agent

Run Deploy Agent (production)
NODE_ENV=production bun nx serve deploy-agent

8. Key Guarantees

Config-validated â†’ if config.* fails schema, system won't run.

Mocks in CI â†’ fast, isolated test runs (no real Mongo/Akash).

Staging deploys cheap â†’ minimal profile saves tokens.

Production deploys gated â†’ requires manual approval.

Spec is truth â†’ agents, API, QA, Deploy all reference same OpenAPI + BDD specs.

âœ… This doc is designed so your AI coder agents know:

Where specs/configs live.

Which files to consume.

Which commands to run.

What guarantees/tests are enforced.

## Migration to Unified Architecture

For new agents, consider the 371 OS unified architecture:
- **Agent "Brain"**: Define in `../../os-workspace/libs/prompts/agent-definitions/agent-name.yml`
- **Agent "Body"**: Implement in `../../os-workspace/apps/agent-name/`
- **Benefits**: Better separation of concerns, centralized agent definitions, improved maintainability
- **Example**: See the Chief of Staff Agent (Ortega) implementation

Akash Code-Server
Need to install  F:\os-main\questflow\dev-team\akash-console-server

 
 

ðŸ‘‰ Next steps could be adding a rollback job (using Deploy Agent with last good config) to auto-revert production on failure.
