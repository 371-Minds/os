## üß† Revolutionary Architecture Features

### Cognitive Oversight Integration
- **MCP Cognition Layer**: Direct integration with Model Context Protocol for strategic analysis
- **Alignment Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 strategic alignment with Chief AI Orchestrator's workstreams
- **Risk Analysis**: Automated risk assessment with mitigation recommendations
- **Workstream Mapping**: Relevance analysis against active business initiatives

### Human-in-the-Loop Approval Gates
- **Intelligent Pause**: Automatic transition from agent approval to human oversight
- **Enriched Context**: AI-generated summaries with cognitive insights for informed decisions
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Full decision tracking with reasoning and conditions
- **Escalation Support**: Multi-level approval workflows for different proposal types

### Enhanced Agent Decision Making
- **Cognitive Enhancement**: Agents query cognition layer before voting
- **Personality Integration**: Agent traits influence cognitive weight (CEO 1.1x, CFO 1.2x, etc.)
- **Strategic Alignment**: Voting decisions backed by data-driven strategic analysis
- **Dynamic Influence**: Cognitive confidence affects decision certainty
