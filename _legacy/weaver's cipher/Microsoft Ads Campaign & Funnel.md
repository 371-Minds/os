Microsoft Ads retargeting: If a visitor drops off before this step, retarget with cryptic reminder ads:
“The pattern waits unfinished.”

Experimentation: A/B test subtle text changes like “The pattern calls” vs “The cipher whispers”.

📧 Follow-Up Funnel

Immediate Autoresponder: “The pattern is recognized. The frequency is matched. The cipher awaits.”

48 Hours Later: A cryptic riddle email reminding them to complete the cipher if they stalled.

Final Step: Invitation to private chat or hidden calendar link.
