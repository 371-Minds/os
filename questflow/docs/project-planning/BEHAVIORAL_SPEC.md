# Behavioral Specifications (Gherkin/BDD Format)

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for writing behavioral specifications using the Gherkin language format, which supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices.

## Gherkin Syntax Basics

### Structure
```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]
  Description of the feature
  
  Background:
    Given [Common precondition for all scenarios]
    
  Scenario: [Scenario Name]
    Given [Precondition]
    When [Action]
    Then [Expected outcome]
    
  Scenario Outline: [Parameterized Scenario Name]
    Given [Precondition with <parameter>]
    When [Action with <parameter>]
    Then [Expected outcome with <parameter>]
    
    Examples:
      | parameter | expected |
      | value1    | result1  |
      | value2    | result2  |
```

### Keywords
- **Feature**: High-level description of a software feature
- **Background**: Common preconditions for all scenarios in a feature
- **Scenario**: Specific example of system behavior
- **Scenario Outline**: Template for multiple similar scenarios
- **Examples**: Data table for Scenario Outline
- **Given**: Precondition or initial context
- **When**: Action or event that triggers behavior
- **Then**: Expected outcome or result
- **And**: Additional step of the same type
- **But**: Exception or contrast to previous step

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Gherkin Features

1. **Use clear, concise language**
   - Write in business-readable language
   - Avoid technical jargon when possible
   - Use active voice

2. **Focus on behavior, not implementation**
   - Describe what the system should do
   - Avoid specifying how it should do it
   - Concentrate on user goals

3. **Keep scenarios independent**
   - Each scenario should be able to run independently
   - Avoid dependencies between scenarios
   - Use Background for common setup

4. **Use concrete examples**
   - Prefer specific values over abstract concepts
   - Make examples realistic and meaningful
   - Include edge cases and error conditions

### Scenario Design

#### Given Steps
- Set up the initial context
- Create test data
- Establish preconditions
- Example: "Given a user with account balance of $100"

#### When Steps
- Describe the action or event
- Should be single, clear actions
- Example: "When the user transfers $50 to another account"

#### Then Steps
- Specify the expected outcome
- Verify system state or response
- Example: "Then the account balance should be $50"

### Common Patterns

#### CRUD Operations
```gherkin
Feature: User Management

  Scenario: Create a new user
    Given I am on the user registration page
    When I fill in the registration form with valid data
    And I submit the form
    Then a new user account should be created
    And I should receive a confirmation email
```

#### Error Handling
```gherkin
Feature: Login

  Scenario: Invalid credentials
    Given a user exists with username "john" and password "secret"
    When I attempt to login with username "john" and password "wrong"
    Then I should see an error message "Invalid credentials"
    And I should remain on the login page
```

#### Data Validation
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration

  Scenario Outline: Validate email format
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter "<email>" in the email field
    And I submit the form
    Then I should see "<result>"
    
    Examples:
      | email             | result                    |
      | valid@example.com | success message           |
      | invalid.email     | error: invalid email      |
      | @example.com      | error: invalid email      |
```

## Integration with Development Process

### Linking to User Stories
Each feature should correspond to a user story:
```
Feature: [User Story Title]
  As a [User Type]
  I want [Goal]
  So that [Benefit]
```

### Automation Considerations
- Write scenarios with automation in mind
- Use stable selectors and identifiers
- Avoid UI-specific language in Given/Then steps when possible
- Include enough detail for test automation

### Tagging and Organization
Use tags to organize and filter scenarios:
```gherkin
@smoke @user-management
Feature: User Registration

  @positive-case
  Scenario: Successful registration
    # ...
    
  @negative-case @validation
  Scenario: Invalid email format
    # ...
```

## Tools and Frameworks

### Popular BDD Tools
- **Cucumber**: Original BDD framework for multiple languages
- **SpecFlow**: .NET implementation of Cucumber
- **Behave**: Python BDD framework
- **JBehave**: Java BDD framework
- **RSpec**: Ruby testing framework with BDD support

### Reporting and Visualization
- Living documentation generation
- Test execution reports
- Coverage metrics
- Trend analysis

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Keeping Specifications Current
- Review and update specifications regularly
- Align with code changes
- Maintain version control
- Archive obsolete specifications

### Collaboration Practices
- Involve business stakeholders in specification writing
- Conduct regular specification review sessions
- Use collaborative tools for specification development
- Establish clear ownership of specifications
