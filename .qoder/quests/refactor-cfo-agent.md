# CFO Agent (Maya) Refactoring to Unified Architecture

## Overview

This design document outlines the refactoring of the legacy CFO Agent (Maya) from the current Python-based implementation to the modernized unified "brain/body" architecture pattern. The refactoring aligns Maya with the established architectural standards demonstrated by the CTO Agent (Zara) and other C-Suite agents, enabling seamless integration with the 371 OS ecosystem while maintaining Maya's core financial capabilities.

The refactoring transforms Maya from a legacy Python implementation (`cfo_cash.py`) into a modern TypeScript-based agent following the established patterns of separation between configuration ("brain") and execution ("body").

## Architecture Overview

The unified architecture separates the CFO Agent into two distinct components:

```typescript
export class CFOAgent {
  private agentDefinition: AgentDefinition;
  private taskProcessor: FinancialTaskProcessor;
  private financialAnalyzer: FinancialAnalyzer;
  private budgetEngine: BudgetAnalysisEngine;
  private performanceMetrics: FinancialMetrics;

  constructor() {
    this.agentDefinition = this.loadAgentDefinition();
    this.taskProcessor = new FinancialTaskProcessor();
    this.financialAnalyzer = new FinancialAnalyzer();
    this.budgetEngine = new BudgetAnalysisEngine();
    this.performanceMetrics = this.initializeMetrics();
  }

  public async processTask(task: FinancialTask): Promise<FinancialResult> {
    // Task processing implementation
  }
}
```

### Financial Task Processing Logic

The task processor implements intelligent categorization and routing of financial tasks:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant CFO as CFO Agent
    participant Processor as Task Processor
    participant Analyzer as Financial Analyzer
    participant Engine as Budget Engine
    
    Client->>CFO: Submit Financial Task
    CFO->>Processor: Analyze Task Category
    Processor->>Processor: Extract Keywords & Context
    Processor->>CFO: Return Task Analysis
    
    alt Budget Analysis
        CFO->>Engine: Process Budget Task
        Engine->>Engine: Analyze Budget Performance
        Engine->>CFO: Return Budget Recommendations
    else Cost Optimization
        CFO->>Analyzer: Process Cost Analysis
        Analyzer->>Analyzer: Identify Savings Opportunities
        Analyzer->>CFO: Return Optimization Plan
