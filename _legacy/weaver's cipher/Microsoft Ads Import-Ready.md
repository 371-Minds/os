üìå How to Use

Copy the CSV above into Excel or Google Sheets.

Save as CSV (Comma Delimited).

Import into Microsoft Ads Editor ‚Üí It will create your campaign, ad groups, ads, and keywords automatically.

Swap the Final URL (http://weaverscipher.com) with your actual landing page link for The Veil.

‚ö° Would you like me to also generate a separate CSV for retargeting ads (cryptic reminders like ‚ÄúThe pattern waits unfinished‚Äù for drop-offs who don‚Äôt complete The Invitation)? That would give you a full-funnel import set.
