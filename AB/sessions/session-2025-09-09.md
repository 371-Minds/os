## Technical Implementation Details

### Directory Structure
Created the following deployment structure:
```
deployments/
├── universal-tool-server/
│   ├── deploy.yml
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── README.md
├── ceo-agent/
│   ├── deploy.yml
│   └── README.md
├── agent-coordinator/
│   ├── deploy.yml
│   └── README.md
├── README.md
```

### SDL Configuration
Configured Stack Definition Language files for each component with appropriate resource allocation:
- Universal Tool Server: 0.25 CPU, 256MB RAM, 512MB storage
- CEO Agent: 0.5 CPU, 512MB RAM, 1GB storage
- Agent Coordinator: 0.25 CPU, 256MB RAM, 512MB storage

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Created a workflow that:
1. Triggers on pushes to main branch affecting relevant files
2. Sets up Bun environment
3. Installs dependencies
4. Builds the Universal Tool Server
5. Builds and pushes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry
6. Deploys to Akash Network

### Package.json Updates
Added the following deployment scripts:
- `deploy:github:uts`: Deploy Universal Tool Server via GitHub
- `deploy:github:ceo`: Deploy CEO Agent via GitHub
- `deploy:github:coordinator`: Deploy Agent Coordinator via GitHub
- `deploy:github:all`: Deploy all components via GitHub

## Next Session Priorities
- Test the GitHub Deploy integration with a staging deployment
- Validate cost optimization metrics
- Create additional GitHub Actions workflows for other components
- Document troubleshooting guides for common deployment issues
