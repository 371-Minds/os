 * The Nx Workspace Plugin
 *
 * When loaded into an ElizaOS agent, this plugin provides the agent with
 * the ability to:
 *
 * 1. Understand its own codebase structure (dependency graph)
 * 2. Identify what will be affected by changes (affected analysis)
 * 3. Test and validate modifications (automated testing)
 * 4. Build and deploy components (build management)
 * 5. Create new projects and components (scaffold generation)
 * 6. Analyze and optimize the architecture (workspace analysis)
 *
 * This represents the evolutionary leap from agents that just "run" the business
 * to agents that can "build and repair" the business itself.
