The ModuMind Method: Tactical Playbook

Purpose: This document outlines the official, standardized workflow for taking any project from initial concept to a launched, operational, and continuously improving product. It serves as the single source of truth for all project execution within the 371 Minds ecosystem.
Phase 1: Discover (The "Why" and "What")

Goal: To deeply understand the problem space, validate the core idea, define the scope of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and produce a detailed, actionable plan.
Step	Objective	Lead Agent	Inputs	Key Activities	Deliverable(s)	Hand-off To
1.1	Ideation & Briefing	Analyst (Mary)	User's initial idea/concept.	Execute "Project Briefing" mode, using the project-brief-tmpl.txt to guide the user from a high-level idea to a structured brief.	A completed Project Brief.	Product Manager (John)
1.2	Requirements & Planning	Product Manager (John)	The signed-off Project Brief.	Execute the create-prd task to transform the brief into a detailed PRD with Epics and high-level User Stories. Validate the PRD against the pm-checklist.	A comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD).	SPACE Bot (Kimberly)
Phase 2: Space (The "How")

Goal: To create the "Collaboration Playbook" by designing the complete technical and user experience architecture, ensuring all plans are aligned and ready for implementation.
Step	Objective	Lead Agent(s)	Inputs	Key Activities	Deliverable(s)	Hand-off To
2.1	Orchestration & Setup	SPACE Bot (Kimberly)	The PRD.	Execute the "Tactical Playbook Composition" task to structure the architectural phase and prepare the "collaboration space".	A structured Project Workspace.	Architects
2.2	System & UI/UX Architecture	Architect (Fred) & Design Architect (Jane)	The PRD and Project Workspace.	Fred executes the create-architecture task. Jane executes the create-uxui-spec and create-frontend-architecture tasks.	Architecture Document, UI/UX Specification, Frontend Architecture Document.	Product Owner (Sarah)
2.3	Final Plan Validation	Product Owner (Sarah)	All previously created documents.	Execute the checklist-run-task using the po-master-checklist to ensure all documents are complete, consistent, and logically sequenced.	An "Approved MVP Plan".	FLOW Bot (Louis)
Phase 3: Flow (The "Build and Improve")

Goal: To manage the continuous cycle of building, testing, deploying, and optimizing the product, embodying the 80/20 automation principle.
Step	Objective	Lead Agent(s)	Inputs	Key Activities	Deliverable(s)	Hand-off To
3.1	Backlog & Story Generation	FLOW Bot (Louis) coordinating Scrum Master (Bob)	The Approved MVP Plan and Epics.	The FLOW Bot prioritizes work. The SM executes the story-draft-task to create detailed, actionable stories from the Epics.	A "Ready-to-Build" User Story.	Developer Agents
3.2	Implementation & Development	Developer Agents	A single "Ready-to-Build" User Story.	Write and test the code to implement the story's requirements, adhering to all architectural documents and the story-dod-checklist.	Completed, Tested Code for the story.	Scrum Master (Bob) for final review.
3.3	Continuous Improvement	FLOW Bot (Louis) & Yourself	Completed stories, user feedback, and PostHog analytics.	The FLOW Bot executes "Lessons Learned & Knowledge Capture" and "Process Improvement Recommendations." When major issues arise, the Root-to-Rise (R2R) Cycle is initiated.	An Updated Playbook and a smarter system.	This is a continuous loop.
The ModuMind Root-to-Rise (R2R) Cycle

The R2R Cycle is a specialized procedure within the "Flow" phase, initiated when a significant problem or opportunity for improvement is identified. It replaces a generic "root cause analysis" with a forward-looking process for improvement.

    Phase 1: Initiation
        Entry Criteria: A problem is identified that cannot be solved within a single story; initial stakeholder buy-in to investigate is secured.
        Deliverable: A Project Charter defining the problem and initial scope.
        Decision Gate: Project Authorization Review.

    Phase 2: Planning
        Entry Criteria: The Project Charter is approved.
        Deliverable: A detailed Project Plan and Communication Plan for addressing the issue.
        Decision Gate: Plan Approval Review.

    Phase 3: Execution
        Entry Criteria: The resolution plan is approved.
        Deliverable: The implemented solution or process change, along with Progress Reports.
        Decision Gate: Implementation Readiness Review.

    Phase 4: Monitoring
        Entry Criteria: The solution has been implemented and a metrics collection system is in place.
        Deliverable: Performance Metrics Reports and Adjustment Recommendations.
        Decision Gate: Performance Review.

    Phase 5: Closure
        Entry Criteria: The solution's performance is stable and has met its success criteria.
        Deliverable: A Final Report and a Lessons Learned Document for our KnowledgeWarehouse.
        Decision Gate: Project Closure Review.
