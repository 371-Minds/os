## 🎯 Quick Start - Picking Up Where You Left Off

### 1. **Check Current Status** (30 seconds) ⚡
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Use Bun for lightning-fast operations
cd f:\os-main
bun --version                    # Check Bun installation
bun nx --version                 # Check Nx workspace

# Alternative: Traditional npm (slower)
npm --version
npx nx --version
```

### 2. **Fast Dependency Installation** (NEW!) 🚀
```bash
# FASTEST: Use Bun installation script
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File AB/scripts/bun-install.ps1

# OR: Direct Bun command (if Bun already installed)
bun install

# Fallback: npm with legacy peer deps (if needed)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. **Review Last Session** (2 minutes)  
- Read `AB/sessions/session-2025-08-30.md` for complete context
- Check `AB/milestone-tracker.md` for current milestone status

### 3. **Continue from Current Milestone** (varies)
Current milestone: **C2 - Cognitive UI Implementation** 🧠
- Dependencies: ✅ RESOLVED with Bun integration
- Agent Runtime: ✅ VALIDATED with test agent
- Cognitive Engine: ✅ COMPLETE and operational
- Next: Begin UI mode implementation (ExecutiveMode.tsx, etc.)

## 💡 Pro Tips for Efficiency

### For Quick Status Check:
```bash
# FASTEST: Bun-powered system health check
cd f:\os-main && bun AB/scripts/quick-status.js

# Test cognitive engine
bun nx build cognitive-engine

# Test agent with Bun
bun run start:test-agent
```

### For Lightning-Fast Development:
```bash
# Use Bun for all operations (RECOMMENDED)
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun nx build            # Build projects  
bun nx affected -t test # Run affected tests
bun run start:dev       # Start development
```

### For Troubleshooting:
- **Dependencies**: Use `AB/scripts/bun-install.ps1` (lightning fast!)
- **npm fallback**: Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if needed
- **Historical context**: Reference `AB/sessions/` for past solutions

### For Development:
- **ALWAYS use Bun**: `bun nx affected` commands for efficiency
- **Cognitive-aware development**: Consider user cognitive states in UI design
- **Test Galaxy Engine concepts**: Reader's Constellation, CEO's Orrery prototypes
- **Track revolutionary progress**: Use AB folder for cognitive breakthroughs
