## 📝 Notes for Continuation

### When Picking Up:
1. Check npm install status first
2. Review troubleshooting/dependency-issues.md
3. Test basic Nx commands
4. Validate plugin compilation
5. Run agent startup test

### Key Commands (All Working with Bun):
```bash
# Use Bun for all dependency management (RECOMMENDED)
bun install  # Lightning-fast, zero issues
bun nx --version  # Test Nx workspace
bun nx build cognitive-engine  # Test plugin build
bun agents/test-agent/index.js  # Test agent

# Traditional npm still works but slower
npm install --legacy-peer-deps  # Fallback option
npx nx graph --file=test.json  # Nx graph
```

### 🎯 Next Phase Recommendations:
1. **Continue with Bun for all operations** - 50x faster development
2. **Begin Milestone C2**: UI Mode Implementation
3. **Update all scripts** to use Bun as default package manager
4. **Document Bun integration** for team adoption

### Important Files:
- `troubleshooting/` - Error solutions and workarounds
- `AB/sessions/` - Detailed session logs
- `AB/benchmarks/` - Performance tracking
