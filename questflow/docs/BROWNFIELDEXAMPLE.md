🎬 BROWNFIELD INTEGRATION SCENARIO: "The Legacy E-commerce Nightmare"

Picture this: RetroMart Inc. - 15-year-old e-commerce platform, PHP/MySQL spaghetti code, wants 371OS magic

🎯 THE BUSINESS REQUEST
Human: "We want AI agents to handle our inventory management, but we can't break our existing order system. Can 371OS integrate with our current setup?"

PHASE 3: Tech Stack Specialist - Compatibility Assessment
Tech Stack Analysis:

Copy## Legacy Stack Compatibility Report

**Current Stack:** LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP 7.4)
**371OS Requirements:** Node.js agents, blockchain coordination, Akash deployment

### Integration Strategies:

**Option 1: API Bridge Pattern** ✅ RECOMMENDED
- 371OS agents communicate via REST APIs
- Minimal legacy code changes required  
- Risk Level: LOW

**Option 2: Database Direct Access** ⚠️ RISKY
- Agents directly read/write MySQL
- Requires schema modifications
- Risk Level: HIGH

**Option 3: Event-Driven Hybrid** 🔥 OPTIMAL
- Message queue between systems (Redis Pub/Sub)
- Gradual migration path available
- Risk Level: MEDIUM

### Compatibility Score: 7.5/10
- ✅ MySQL integrations mature
- ✅ REST API endpoints exist
- ⚠️ Authentication layer needed
- ❌ Real-time sync challenges

🚀 FINAL INTEGRATION SPEC
CopyFeature: Legacy E-commerce 371OS Integration
  As RetroMart's CTO
  I want to integrate 371OS inventory agents
  So that we get AI automation without breaking existing systems

  Background:
    Given the legacy PHP e-commerce system is running
    And the MySQL inventory database is accessible
    And 371OS agents are deployed on Akash Network

  Scenario: Successful inventory sync via API bridge
    Given an inventory update occurs in the legacy system  
    When the update triggers the Redis message queue
    Then the 371OS Inventory Agent processes the update
    And the agent validates inventory levels
    And the agent updates stock recommendations
    And no existing order functionality is affected

  Scenario: Failover protection during peak traffic
    Given Black Friday traffic levels (10x normal)
    When any 371OS component experiences issues
    Then the system automatically fails over to legacy inventory
    And all order processing continues normally
    And the incident is logged for post-analysis
Jim Halpert wink at camera

"And THAT, my friend, is how you turn a 15-year-old PHP nightmare into a 371OS success story without breaking everything!" 🎉

The beautiful part? Your agents just orchestrated a $300k+ annual value integration while respecting every legacy constraint. That's some serious AI business magic! ✨
