# CTO Agent (Zara) Refactoring Design

## Overview

The CTO Agent (Zara) refactoring implements the unified "brain/body" architecture pattern within the 371 OS ecosystem. This transformation separates the agent's cognitive definition (brain) from its execution runtime (body), enabling centralized prompt management and standardized agent coordination. The refactored agent will serve as a primary technical leadership component for tasks delegated by the intelligent router.

### Design Objectives

- Migrate legacy CTO agent implementation to unified architecture pattern
- Establish centralized brain configuration in prompt library
- Create standardized execution runtime following proven patterns
- Enable seamless integration with intelligent task routing system
- Maintain technical leadership capabilities while improving system coherence

## Architecture

### Agent Architecture Pattern

The CTO Agent follows the established brain/body separation pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Brain (Configuration)"
        A[Agent Definition YAML] --> B[Core Instructions]
        A --> C[Personality Traits]
        A --> D[Technical Capabilities]
        A --> E[Decision Framework]
    end
    
    subgraph "Body (Execution Runtime)"
        F[Nx Application] --> G[Agent Loader]
        F --> H[Task Processor]
        F --> I[Technical Analyzer]
        F --> J[Decision Engine]
    end
    
    subgraph "Integration Layer"
        K[Intelligent Router] --> L[Task Delegation]
        M[Agent Registry] --> N[Capability Discovery]
        O[Performance Monitor] --> P[Metrics Collection]
    end
    
    A --> F
    L --> H
    N --> D
    P --> J
```

### Component Architecture

The CTO Agent consists of three primary architectural layers:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Configuration Layer"
        A[cto_agent.yml]
        B[Technical Capabilities]
        C[Decision Rules]
    end
    
    subgraph "Processing Layer"
        D[Task Analyzer]
        E[Technical Evaluator]
        F[Architecture Designer]
        G[Infrastructure Planner]
    end
    
    subgraph "Execution Layer"
        H[Mock Decision Engine]
        I[Logging System]
        J[Performance Tracker]
    end
    
    A --> D
    B --> E
    C --> F
    D --> H
    E --> I
    F --> J
```
