## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Development Issues

#### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Problem**: Interface compatibility errors with ElizaOS core types

```
Interface 'BusinessDataCollectionAction' incorrectly extends interface 'Action'
Types of property 'handler' are incompatible
```

**Solution**: Update handler signatures to match ElizaOS Handler type:

```typescript
// ❌ Incorrect
handler: (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State) => Promise<ActionResult>

// ✅ Correct
handler: (
  runtime: IAgentRuntime,
  message: Memory, 
  state?: State,
  options?: any,
  callback?: any,
  responses?: Memory[]
) => Promise<ActionResult | void | undefined>
```

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- Changed `state: State` to `state?: State` (optional parameter)
- Added missing `callback` and `responses` parameters
- Updated return type to `Promise<ActionResult | void | undefined>`
- Added `ActionResult` and `ProviderResult` imports from `@elizaos/core`

#### 2. TypeScript Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Cross-plugin file inclusion errors

```
File 'f:/os-main/packages/elizaos-plugins/nx-workspace/src/index.ts' is not under 'rootDir'
```

**Solution**: Update `tsconfig.json` with proper module isolation:

```json
{
  "extends": "../../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"],
    "isolatedModules": true,
    // ... other options
  },
  "exclude": [
    "../nx-workspace/**/*",
    "../cognitive-engine/**/*",
    "../universal-tool-server/**/*"
  ]
}
```

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- Corrected relative path to `tsconfig.base.json`
- Added `"lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"]` for modern JavaScript features
- Added explicit exclusions for other plugin directories
- Added `isolatedModules: true` for better type safety

#### 3. Build System Issues

**Problem**: Cannot find module 'tsup' TypeScript error

```
Cannot find module 'tsup' or its corresponding type declarations
```

**Solution**: Install dependencies and resolve Windows lockfile conflicts:

```bash
# For Windows environments with lockfile issues
bun install --force --no-save

# Verify tsup installation
bun run build
```

**Build Output Validation**:
```
ESM dist/index.js     38.26 KB
CJS dist/index.cjs    39.74 KB  
DTS dist/index.d.ts   8.52 KB
```

#### 4. Missing Test Configuration

**Problem**: Missing `tsconfig.spec.json` file causing TypeScript errors

```
File 'tsconfig.spec.json' not found
```

**Solution**: Create missing test configuration file:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "../../dist/out-tsc",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "types": ["jest", "node"]
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.spec.ts",
    "src/**/*.test.ts",
    "src/**/*.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

### Windows Development Environment

#### Bun Installation and Lockfile Issues

**Common Issue**: Bun lockfile conflicts on Windows

```
EINVAL: Failed to replace old lockfile with new lockfile on disk
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Use `--no-save` flag** (recommended for development):
   ```bash
   bun install --force --no-save
   ```

2. **Clear lockfile and retry**:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item bun.lockb -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   bun install
   ```

3. **Use PowerShell with elevated permissions**:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "cd 'path/to/plugin'; bun install"
   ```

#### PowerShell Script Execution

**Issue**: Script execution blocked by Windows execution policy

**Solution**: Use ExecutionPolicy Bypass:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script-name.ps1
```

### ElizaOS Integration Issues

#### Import Validation

**Problem**: Invalid ElizaOS core imports

**Solution**: Verify actual exports before using:

```bash
# Test ElizaOS core exports
node -e "console.log(Object.keys(require('@elizaos/core')))"
```

**Verified Working Imports**:
```typescript
import { 
  Action, 
  Provider, 
  Evaluator, 
  IAgentRuntime, 
  Memory, 
  State,
  ActionResult,
  ProviderResult 
} from '@elizaos/core';
```

### Build Performance Optimization

#### Dependency Installation Speed

**Bun vs npm Performance**:
- **Bun**: ~60 seconds for 538 packages
- **npm**: 30+ minutes (with frequent hangs)
- **Recommendation**: Always use Bun for 371 OS development

#### Build Optimization

**tsup Configuration** for optimal performance:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['src/index.ts'],
  format: ['esm', 'cjs'],
  dts: true,
  clean: true,
  sourcemap: true,
  minify: false,
  external: ['@elizaos/core'],
  banner: {
    js: '// Business Intelligence Plugin for ElizaOS - Revolutionary AI-powered business analytics'
  }
});
```

### Validation Commands

#### Complete System Validation

```bash
# TypeScript compilation check
bun run tsc --noEmit

# Build verification  
bun run build

# Test execution
bun run test

# Lint check
bun run lint
```

#### Expected Build Output

```
CLI tsup v8.5.0
ESM ⚡️ Build success in 1364ms
CJS ⚡️ Build success in 1360ms  
DTS ⚡️ Build success in 3307ms
```

### Documentation for Future Development

#### ElizaOS Plugin Standards

1. **Handler Function Signatures**: Always use optional `state` parameter
2. **Return Types**: Use `Promise<ActionResult | void | undefined>`
3. **Import Strategy**: Use explicit imports from `@elizaos/core`
4. **Module Isolation**: Exclude other plugins in `tsconfig.json`
5. **Build Configuration**: Use `tsup` with dual ESM/CJS output

#### Windows Development Best Practices

1. **Package Manager**: Prefer Bun over npm for speed and reliability
2. **Lockfile Strategy**: Use `--no-save` flag to avoid Windows conflicts
3. **Script Execution**: Always use `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for PowerShell
4. **Path Configuration**: Use forward slashes in JSON configurations

#### Testing Strategy

1. **TypeScript Validation**: Run `tsc --noEmit` before builds
2. **Build Verification**: Ensure all output formats generate correctly
3. **Plugin Integration**: Test with actual ElizaOS runtime
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Validate on both Windows and Unix systems
