Question: Define trustworthy AI characteristics per NIST.
verbatim: ‚ÄúFor AI systems to be trustworthy, they often need to be responsive to a multiplicity of criteria that are of value to interested parties. Approaches which enhance AI trustworthiness can reduce negative AI risks. This Framework articulates the following characteristics of trustworthy AI and offers guidance for addressing them. Characteristics of trustworthy AI systems include: valid and reliable, safe, secure and resilient, accountable and transparent, explainable and interpretable, privacy-enhanced, and fair with harmful bias managed.‚Äù (Page 17) answer: NIST AI RMF 1.0 defines seven characteristics of trustworthy AI systems:

Valid and Reliable: AI systems must be validated‚Äî‚Äúconfirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled‚Äù (ISO 9000:2015)‚Äîand reliable‚Äî‚Äúability of an item to perform as required, without failure, for a given time interval, under given conditions‚Äù (ISO/IEC TS 5723:2022).
Safe: AI systems ‚Äúshould not under defined conditions, lead to a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is endangered‚Äù (ISO/IEC TS 5723:2022).
Secure and Resilient: AI systems and their ecosystems must maintain functionality and structure in the face of internal and external adverse events, with protections for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (drawing on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework).
Accountable and Transparent: Information about AI systems and their outputs must be appropriately available to relevant stakeholders, enabling auditability, redress, and alignment with internal and external norms.
Explainable and Interpretable: AI systems must provide representations of how they operate (explainability) and enable users to make sense of outputs in context (interpretability).
Privacy-Enhanced: AI systems must safeguard individual autonomy, identity, and dignity by employing privacy-enhancing technologies, data minimization, and controls on data use.
Fair with Harmful Bias Managed: AI systems must address and mitigate systemic, computational/statistical, and human-cognitive biases to promote equity and prevent discriminatory impacts.
Question: What are the core functions of the RMF?
verbatim: ‚ÄúThe AI RMF Core provides outcomes and actions that enable dialogue, understanding, and activities to manage AI risks and responsibly develop trustworthy AI systems. As illustrated in Figure 5, the Core is composed of four functions: GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, and MANAGE.‚Äù (Page 20) answer: The AI RMF Core comprises four cross‚Äêcutting functions for AI risk management:

GOVERN: Cultivate a culture of AI risk management through policies, accountability structures, roles and responsibilities, inventorying, and lifecycle controls.
MAP: Establish and document context, objectives, risk tolerances, system categorization, and potential impacts across design, data, model, and deployment.
MEASURE: Select and apply quantitative and qualitative metrics and TEVV (test, evaluation, verification, validation) processes to assess trustworthy characteristics, track emergent risks, and evaluate controls.
MANAGE: Prioritize risk treatments, allocate resources, sustain benefits, respond to incidents, decommission systems safely, and communicate residual risks.
Question: Any governance and lifecycle guidance highlights?
verbatim: ‚ÄúThe GOVERN function:

cultivates and implements a culture of risk management within organizations designing, developing, deploying, evaluating, or acquiring AI systems;
outlines processes, documents, and organizational schemes that anticipate, identify, and manage the risks a system can pose ...‚Äù (Pages 21‚Äì22)
‚ÄúTEVV tasks are performed throughout the AI lifecycle. They are carried out by AI actors who examine the AI system or its components, or detect and remediate problems. Ideally, AI actors carrying out verification and validation tasks are distinct from those who perform test and evaluation actions.‚Äù (Appendix A, Page 41) answer: Key governance and lifecycle guidance in AI RMF 1.0 includes:

GOVERN as a cross‚Äêcutting function, infused throughout the AI lifecycle, to establish policies, procedures, accountability structures (roles, training, executive oversight), inventory and decommissioning processes, and mechanisms for third‚Äêparty and supply‚Äêchain risk controls.
Integration of TEVV (test, evaluation, verification, validation) tasks at every phase‚Äîdesign, data preparation, model development, deployment, and operation‚Äîto detect, assess, and remediate risks.
Definition of AI actor roles across lifecycle dimensions (Application Context, Data & Input, AI Model, Task & Output, Operation & Monitoring), ensuring interdisciplinary, demographically diverse teams and clear human‚ÄêAI configurations.
Emphasis on continuous monitoring, stakeholder engagement (external feedback, impacted communities), and iterative review to adapt governance and lifecycle practices as contexts and risks evolve.

It is an implementation of the AI RMF functions, categories, and subcategories tailored for GAI. It offers insights into how GAI risks can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle. Specifically, this document defines risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI and provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, map, measure, and manage these risks.

Question: Any risk categories specific to GAI?
verbatim: AI risks can diÔ¨Äer from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI risks, and creates unique risks. To guide organizations in identifying and managing GAI risks, a set of risks unique to or exacerbated by the development and use of GAI are deÔ¨Åned below. Each risk is labeled according to the outcome, object, or source of the risk (i.e., some are risks ‚Äúto‚Äù a subject or domain and others are risks ‚Äúof‚Äù or ‚Äúfrom‚Äù an issue or theme). These risks provide a lens through which organizations can frame and execute risk management eÔ¨Äorts.

CBRN Information or Capabilities: Eased access to or synthesis of materially nefarious information or design capabilities related to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons or other dangerous materials or agents.
Confabulation: The production of conÔ¨Ådently stated but erroneous or false content (known colloquially as ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù or ‚Äúfabrications‚Äù) by which users may be misled or deceived.
Dangerous, Violent, or Hateful Content: Eased production of and access to violent, inciting, radicalizing, or threatening content as well as recommendations to carry out self-harm or conduct illegal activities. Includes diÔ¨Éculty controlling public exposure to hateful and disparaging or stereotyping content.

Environmental Impacts: Impacts due to high compute resource utilization in training or operating GAI models, and related outcomes that may adversely impact ecosystems.
Harmful Bias or Homogenization: AmpliÔ¨Åcation and exacerbation of historical, societal, and systemic biases; performance disparities between sub-groups or languages, possibly due to non-representative training data, that result in discrimination, ampliÔ¨Åcation of biases, or incorrect presumptions about performance; undesired homogeneity that skews system or model outputs, which may be erroneous, lead to ill-founded decision-making, or amplify harmful biases.
Human-AI ConÔ¨Åguration: Arrangements of or interactions between a human and an AI system which can result in the human inappropriately anthropomorphizing GAI systems or experiencing algorithmic aversion, automation bias, over-reliance, or emotional entanglement with GAI systems.
Information Integrity: Lowered barrier to entry to generate and support the exchange and consumption of content which may not distinguish fact from opinion or Ô¨Åction or acknowledge uncertainties, or could be leveraged for large-scale dis- and mis-information campaigns.
Information Security: Lowered barriers for oÔ¨Äensive cyber capabilities, including via automated discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities to ease hacking, malware, phishing, oÔ¨Äensive cyber operations, or other cyberattacks; increased attack surface for targeted cyberattacks, which may compromise a system‚Äôs availability or the conÔ¨Ådentiality or integrity of training data, code, or model weights.
Intellectual Property: Eased production or replication of alleged copyrighted, trademarked, or licensed content without authorization (possibly in situations which do not fall under fair use); eased exposure of trade secrets; or plagiarism or illegal replication.
Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content: Eased production of and access to obscene, degrading, and/or abusive imagery which can cause harm, including synthetic child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) of adults.
Value Chain and Component Integration: Non-transparent or untraceable integration of upstream third-party components, including data that has been improperly obtained or not processed and cleaned due to increased automation from GAI; improper supplier vetting across the AI lifecycle; or other issues that diminish transparency or accountability for downstream users. answer: Yes, the document defines a set of 12 risk categories that are unique to or exacerbated by Generative AI (GAI):
CBRN Information or Capabilities: Eased access to or synthesis of nefarious information or design capabilities related to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons or other dangerous materials or agents.
Confabulation: The production of confidently stated but erroneous or false content (colloquially known as ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù or ‚Äúfabrications‚Äù) by which users may be misled or deceived.
Dangerous, Violent, or Hateful Content: Eased production of and access to violent, inciting, radicalizing, or threatening content, as well as recommendations for self-harm or illegal activities, and difficulty controlling public exposure to hateful content.
Data Privacy: Impacts due to leakage and unauthorized use, disclosure, or de-anonymization of biometric, health, location, or other personally identifiable information or sensitive data.
Environmental Impacts: Impacts due to high compute resource utilization in training or operating GAI models and related adverse outcomes for ecosystems.

Question: How is it positioned as AI management system standard?
verbatim: ISO/IEC 42001 is the world‚Äôs first AI management system standard, providing valuable guidance for this rapidly changing field of technology. It addresses the unique challenges AI poses, such as ethical considerations, transparency, and continuous learning. For organizations, it sets out a structured way to manage risks and opportunities associated with AI, balancing innovation with governance. ISO has a number of standards that help mitigate the risks and maximize the rewards of AI, including ISO/IEC 22989, which establishes terminology for AI and describes concepts in the field of AI; ISO/IEC 23053, which establishes an AI and machine learning (ML) framework for describing a generic AI system using ML technology; and ISO/IEC 23894, which provides guidance on AI-related risk management for organizations. ISO/IEC 42001 on the other hand is a management system standard (MSS). Implementing this standard means putting in place policies and procedures for the sound governance of an organization in relation to AI, using the PlanDoCheckAct methodology. Rather than looking at the details of specific AI applications, it provides a practical way of managing AI-related risks and opportunities across an organization. It therefore provides value for any business or entity. answer: ISO/IEC 42001 is positioned as the world‚Äôs first AI management system standard (MSS).

Images:
Figure 2: Core Zero Trust Logical Components Figure 3: Device Agent/Gateway Model

Question: Summarize Zero Trust tenets and goals.
verbatim: ‚ÄúA zero trust architecture is designed and deployed with adherence to the following zero trust basic tenets:

All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
All communication is secured regardless of network location.
Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.
Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy‚Äîincluding the observable state of client identity, application/service, and the requesting asset‚Äîand may include other behavioral and environmental attributes.
The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets.
All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.
The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure and communications and uses it to improve its security posture.‚Äù answer: Zero Trust‚Äôs primary goals are to prevent implicit trust and grant resource access only after continuous evaluation of identity, device posture, and context. Its seven basic tenets are:
Treat every data source and computing service as a protected resource.
Secure all communication‚Äîencrypt and authenticate‚Äîregardless of network location.
Grant access to resources on a per-session basis, using least privilege.
Make access decisions by dynamic policy that considers user identity, application/service, device posture, behavior, and environment.
Continuously monitor and measure the integrity and security posture of all assets‚Äîenterprise-owned and associated.
Enforce dynamic authentication and authorization for every resource request before granting access.
Collect comprehensive telemetry on assets, network traffic, and communications to continually refine security posture.

‚Ä¢ Device Application Sandboxing‚Äù answer: Yes. NIST SP 800-207 defines both logical components and deployment models for Zero Trust Architecture:

Logical Components:

Policy Engine (PE) ‚Äì makes grant/deny decisions using policy, asset status, identity attributes, and threat intelligence.
Policy Administrator (PA) ‚Äì enforces PE decisions by configuring or tearing down secure communication paths.
Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) ‚Äì the gatekeeper that routes or blocks access to resources per PA instructions.
Architecture Models (Deployment Variations):

Enhanced Identity Governance ‚Äì using identity attributes as the primary driver of policy decisions.
Micro-Segmentation ‚Äì placing gateways or host-based controls around individual resources or workloads.
Software Defined Perimeter ‚Äì leveraging network overlays or SDN/intent-based networking to dynamically connect clients to resources.
Specific Deployment Patterns: ‚Ä¢ Device Agent/Gateway ‚Äì a client-side agent and resource gateway act as PEPs. ‚Ä¢ Enclave Gateway ‚Äì a gateway protects a cluster (enclave) of resources behind a single PEP. ‚Ä¢ Resource Portal ‚Äì a web or network portal serves as the sole PEP for resource access. ‚Ä¢ Application Sandboxing ‚Äì isolating approved applications on client devices to limit exposure and enforce PEP policy.

One of the basic tenets of zero trust is to remove the implicit trust in users, services, and devices based only on their network location, affiliation, and ownership. NIST Special Publication 800-207 has laid out a comprehensive set of zero trust principles and referenced zero trust architectures (ZTA) for turning those concepts into reality. A key paradigm shift in ZTAs is the change in focus from security controls based on segmentation and isolation using network parameters (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, subnets, perimeter) to identities. From an application security point of view, this requires authentication and authorization policies based on application and service identities in addition to the underlying network parameters and user identities. This in turn requires a platform that consists of Application Programming Interface (API) gateways, sidecar proxies, and application identity infrastructures (e.g., Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone [SPIFFE]) that can enforce those policies irrespective of the location of the services or applications, whether on-premises or on multiple clouds. The objective of this publication is to provide guidance for realizing an architecture that can enforce granular application-level policies while meeting the runtime requirements of ZTA for multi-cloud and hybrid environments.

Secretless Broker relieves applications of the need to directly handle secrets. When an application requires access to a TCP-based service, such as a database, web service, or SSH connection, it can connect to the local Secretless Broker_without credentials_ rather than connect to the service directly.

You can configure Secretless Broker to retrieve credentials for each connection from any of several credential stores and inject the credentials into the connection request. Once the connection is made, Secretless Broker seamlessly streams the connection between the client and the service. Secretless Broker can coordinate connections to multiple services simultaneously.

Why Secretless?
The Secretless Broker solves two problems.

First, it prevents the loss or theft of credentials from applications and services, which can occur by:

| Problem

|

Description

| | --- | --- | | Accidental credential leakage | For example, when credentials are written to a log file or checked into source control. | | An attack on a privileged user | For example, phishing or developer machine compromises. | | A vulnerability in an application | For example, remote code execution or environment variable dump. |

Second, Secretless Broker manages how applications interact with secrets vaults. The Secretless Broker eliminates the need to modify code to fetch requested credentials and the time spent implementing and maintaining connections to vaults. Time better spent delivering business value.

Prevent credential loss and theft
Keeping secrets in a vault is good practice. However, when a client application requests a secret from the vault, it often is stored in unprotected application memory, adding the application to the threat surface. Even if an organization implements and enforces stringent best practices, such storing secrets in a vault and application hardening, this can guarantee 0-day vulnerabilities in the application, underlying framework, or programming language used.

Focus on adding business value
Instead of focusing resources on mitigating the risks of end users and developers passing secrets to applications, use the Secretless Broker which abstracts away the security to a specialized module that can be audited and expanded with custom plugin. The Secretless Broker supports a variety of vault solutions and secures the secrets consistently across technologies and platforms.

Solution benefits
The client does not have to know how to fetch credentials.

Secret rotations are handled seamlessly.

The client/app no longer has to directly interact with a secrets vault and no code must be changed to fetch credentials before opening a connection. If the vault used changes when the environment or platform changes no changes in code are required, thus reducing the probability of human error and bugs.

The client is not part of the threat surface.

The client/app no longer has direct access to the password, and therefore cannot reveal it.

The client doesnt have to know how to properly manage secrets.

Handling secrets safely involves some complexities, and when every application needs to know how to handle secrets, accidents happen. Secretless Broker centralizes the client-side management of secrets into one code base, making it easier for developers to focus on delivering features.

In a Secretless Broker deployment, when a client needs access to a Target Service it doesn't try to make a direct connection. Instead, it sends the request through its Secretless Broker.



The Secretless Broker authenticates with a secrets vault and obtains an identity credential. The identity credential is managed securely within the Secretless Broker, and is used to obtain a secret in order to access the Target Service, such as a database password from the secrets vault. The connection secrets are managed entirely within the Secretless Broker process, and are never exposed to the client. The Secretless Broker uses the connection secret to establish a connection to the Target Service and then transmits data between the client and the target.

Standard Secretless workflow
A Client (user or code) connects to the Secretless Broker (a local service) to obtain a connection to the Target Service (a database, server or web service).

If needed, the Secretless Broker authenticates with an external vault to obtain an identity credential, which is managed securely within the Secretless Broker process.

The Secretless Broker uses the identity credential to obtain secrets that allow access to the Target Service. Secrets are managed securely by the Secretless Broker process.

Secretless Broker uses the secrets to open a connection to the Target Service.

Secretless Broker pipes traffic between the Client and the Target Service.

If a secret is changed either manually or with a rotator, the Broker automatically obtains the new secret and uses it when establishing new connections.

Secretless eliminates the need to restart any service when a secret is rotated.

The Secretless Broker is a proxy that intercepts traffic to the Target Service and performs the authentication phase of the back-end protocol. The data-transfer phases of the protocol are direct pass-through between the client and Target Service.

Examples of protocols that can be brokered include:

Database protocols such as Oracle, Postgresql, MySQL, NoSQL flavors, etc.

HTTP via Authorization header

SSH, via MITM or by implementing an ssh-agent

Any published protocol can be supported in the Secretless Broker. Software code in the Secretless Broker is generally required for each new protocol. For a list of currently-supported Target Services, see the Secretless Service Connectors.

The Secretless Broker typically runs locally alongside the client application. Authentication between the Client and the Secretless Broker is managed by the operating system, e.g. local connection via Unix socket or HTTP connection to 127.0.0.1. In container-managed environments such as Kubernetes, the Secretless Broker can be a "sidecar" container, which is securely networked to the application container.

Internal Secretless architecture


Internally, when Secretless starts, it also starts the Proxy Services for each configured service and ensures that they are each listening on the appropriate socket.

When Secretless receives a new connection request on a given socket:

The request is automatically received by the Proxy Service configured for that service.

The Proxy Service invokes the appropriate Credential Provider(s) to retrieve the required credentials.

The Proxy Service invokes the appropriate Service Connector to perform the authentication handshake.

Secretless seamlessly streams the connection.

July 2025 (document history)

Organizations are adopting large language models (LLMs) and software agents to solve dynamic, multidomain problems using a new architectural discipline called agentic patterns. Agentic patterns are foundational blueprints and modular constructs that are used to design and orchestrate goal-oriented AI agents across many contexts.

Intended audience
This guide is intended for architects, developers, and product leaders who want to build intelligent applications that go beyond static logic, symbolic logic, and deterministic automation.

Objectives
This guide provides a design framework and implementation approach for AI agent systems that operate autonomously while remaining controllable and aligned with your goals. It connects event-driven architectural patterns with various agentic alternatives, demonstrating how to build production-grade agent systems using cloud-native architectures. The following subjects are discussed in this guide:

Agent patterns Agent patterns are reusable design templates that describe the structure and behavior of individual agents. This includes reasoning agents, retrieval-augmented agents, coding agents, voice interfaces, workflow orchestrators, and collaborative multi-agent systems. Each pattern illustrates how agents perceive, reason, act, and learn, mapped to AWS services.

LLM workflows Workflows focus on how agents use LLMs for reasoning. They explore prompting strategies and planning mechanisms, and outline how LLMs are used not only to generate text but also to drive structured, interpretable, and reliable behaviors within an agent loop.

Agentic workflow patterns Workflow patterns describe how multiple agents, tools, and environments interact to form autonomous systems. This includes patterns for task orchestration, subagent delegation, event-based coordination, observability, and control. These aspects promote scalable, composable, and auditable AI architectures.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/agentic-ai-patterns/from-event-driven-to-cognition-augmented-systems.html
Modern cloud architectures, particularly those built on serverless and event-driven principles, have traditionally relied on patterns like routing, fan-out, and enrichment to create responsive, scalable systems. Agentic AI systems build upon these foundations while reframing them around LLM-augmented reasoning and cognitive flexibility. This approach allows for more sophisticated problem-solving and automation capabilities, potentially revolutionizing how complex tasks are handled in cloud environments.

Event-driven architecture
The following diagram shows a typical distributed system:

Event-driven architecture with data enrichment.

A user submits a request to Amazon API Gateway.

Amazon API Gateway routes the request to an AWS Lambda function.

AWS Lambda performs data enrichment by querying an Amazon Aurora database

Amazon API Gateway returns the enriched payload to the caller.

This structure is both reliable and scalable, but it's fundamentally static. Business rules and logic paths must be explicitly coded, and adapting to changing contexts or incomplete information is limited.

Cognition-augmented workflows
Agentic architectures add cognitive augmentation to an event-driven system. The following diagram shows an agentic equivalent:

Cognition-augmented workflow.

A user submits a query through an SDK or API call.

An Amazon Bedrock agent receives the query.

The agent interprets the query by invoking an LLM

The agent performs semantic enrichment by searching the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base or other external data sources.

The LLM synthesizes a context-rich, goal-aligned response.

The system returns a synthesized response to the user.

In this flow, the LLM uses logic, understands intent, retrieves and combines relevant context, and then decides how best to respond. This pattern mirrors the traditional enrichment pattern, where messages are augmented with external data before being routed further. In agentic systems, however, this enrichment is not a static lookup. Instead, the enrichment is dynamic, semantically guided, and driven by purpose.

Core insights
Each LLM workflow can be mapped to an agentic workflow pattern, which mirrors and evolves traditional event-driven architecture styles. A basic building block of agentic workflows is the ability to augment an LLM's context with data, tools and memory. This creates a reasoning loop that's informed, adaptive, and aligned with user intent. Where traditional systems enrich messages with lookup data, agentic systems enable software to act less like scripts and more like intelligent collaborators.

https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/machinelearningblog/baseline-agentic-ai-systems-architecture/4207137
summary: This article outlines a baseline architecture for Agentic AI Systems using Azure services, focusing on components like Azure AI Studio, Azure Container Apps, and Azure API Management, emphasizing secure and efficient deployment for complex AI applications. It details how these components facilitate planning, memory, and tool usage for autonomous AI agents while mitigating security risks.
Question: What is the baseline architecture and components?
verbatim: This article provides a baseline architecture for building and deploying Agentic AI Systems that use frameworks like AutoGen, LangChain, LlamaIndex or Semantic Kernel. It is based on Baseline OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture [4]. It provides Azure Container Apps or Azure Kubernetes Services as the main platform to deploy agents, orchestrator, API and prompt flow. For certain models, it is required to have a Machine Learning Workspace, therefore we integrated it also in the architecture. To use Azure Open AI efficiently we propose to place the service behin an Azure API Management that provides policies dedicated to the Azure OpenAI service. Optionnaly if a UI is required, we propose to use App Service. Outside of the workloads network, an Azure Container Apps environment is deployed with serverless code interpreter session (preview) [3] to run the code generated by agents.

Many components of this proposed architecture are similar to the Baseline OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture [4] as the main components of Agentic AI Systems are Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search and Azure AI Services. We are going to highlight the main components of this architecture.

Azure AI Studio [5] is a managed cloud service used to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models, including large language models (LLM), small language models (SLM), and multi-modal models used by the agents. The platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools and services to facilitate the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. Key features of the Azure AI Studio include:
Prompt Flow [6] is a development tool designed to streamline the entire development lifecycle of Generative AI applications. It supports creating, testing, and deploying prompt flows, which can be used to generate responses or actions based on given prompts. These prompt flows can be deployed to a Machine Learning Workspace or containerized and deployed to Azure Container Apps or Azure Kubernetes Services [7]. AI Studio can also be used to develop and deploy these prompt flows.
Managed Online Endpoints are used by agents and backend services to invoke prompt flows for real-time inference. They provide scalable, reliable, and secure endpoints for deploying machine learning models, enabling real-time decision-making and interactions [7].
Azure AI Dependencies include essential Azure services and resources that support the functioning of AI Studio and associated projects [8]:
Azure Storage Account stores artifacts for projects, such as prompt flows and evaluation data. It is primarily used by the AI Studio to manage data and model assets.
Azure AI Search, a comprehensive cloud search service that supports full-text search, semantic search, vector search, and hybrid search. It provides search capabilities for AI projects and agents and is essential for implementing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. This pattern involves extracting relevant queries from a prompt, querying the AI Search service, and using the results to generate a response using an LLM or SLM model.
Azure Key Vault used for securely storing and managing secrets, keys, and certificates required by agents, AI projects, and backend services.
Azure Container Registry stores and manages container images of agents, backend APIs, orchestrators, and other components. It also stores images created when using a custom runtime for prompt flows.
Azure OpenAI service enables natural language processing tasks like text generation, summarization, and conversation.
Azure AI Services offers APIs for vision, speech, language, and decision-making, including custom models.
Document Intelligence extracts data from documents for intelligent processing.
Azure Speech converts speech to text and vice versa, with translation capabilities.
Content AI Safety ensures AI-generated content is ethical and safe, preventing the creation or spread of harmful or biased material.
Azure Cosmos DB is well suited for Agentic AI Systems and AI agent [9]. It can provide "session" memory with the message history for conversable agents (e.g. ConversableAgent.chat_messages in Autogen [9, 10]). It can also be used for LLM caching [9, 11]. Finally it could be used as a vector database [9, 12].
Azure Cache for Redis is an in-memory store that can be used to store short term memory for agents and LLM caching like for Autogen [11, 13]. It could also be used by backend services to improve performance and as a session store [13].
Azure API Management is, for us, a core architectural component to manage access to the Azure OpenAI service, especially when it is used by multiple agents. First, you can import your OpenAI API in the API Management directly or using an OpenAPI specification [14]. When imported, you have multiple ways to authenticate and authorize access to Azure OpenAI APIs using API Management policies [15]. You can also use API Management to monitor and analyze the usage of the Azure OpenAI service [16], set a token limit policy [17], and enable semantic caching of the responses to Azure OpenAI requests to reduce bandwidth, processing requirements, and latency [18]. For semantic caching, the deployed Azure Cache for Redis can be used [18]. Finally, with API Management policies, you can implement smart load balancing of Azure OpenAI service [19-21]. For all these reasons, in this architecture, the agents are not calling directly the Azure OpenAI service but are calling it through the Azure API Management. API Management is also used to exposed API of the backend services to the agents and the external world.
Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform designed focus on containerized applications and less on the infrastructure [22]. It is well suited for Agentic AI Systems. Agents, orchestrator, prompt flows and backend API can all be deployed as Container Apps. It provides a reliable solution for your agents, orchestrator, prompt flows and backend API. They can scaled automatically regarding the load. Container Apps also provide Dapr integration that helps you implement simple, portable, resilient and secure microservices and agents [23].
For asynchronous between agents and between agents and an orchestrator, we propose to use Azure Service Bus. It is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics [24]. It provides a decoupled communication between agents and between agents and an orchestrator. Dapr can be used to communicate with Azure Service Bus [24]. Dapr provides resiliency policies for communication with Azure Service Bus (preview) [25].
For synchronous communication between agents and between agents and an orchestrator, you can Dapr service-to-service invocation. It is a simple way to call another service (agent or orchestrator) directly with authomatic mTLS authentication and encryption and using service discovery [24]. Dapr also provides resiliency for calling services but it cannot be applied to requests made using the Dapr Service Invocation API [26].
An Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) architecture is provided below. You can deploy Dapr on Azure Kubernetes Services or use service meshes for direct communication between agents and between agents and an orchestrator. Azure Kubernetes Services provides also a reliable solution for your agents, orchestrator, prompt flows and backend API.
Azure Containers Apps Code Interpreter Sessions (preview) is fully isolated and is designed to run untrusted code [3]. It is is provided by Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions (preview) that provides fast access to secured sandbox environment with strong isolation [27]. Code interpreter sessions are fully isolated form each other by a Hyper-V boundary, providing enterprise-grade security and isolation [3, 27]. Outbound traffic can also be restricted [3]. By default, Python code interpreter sessions include popular Python packages such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn [3]. You can also create custom Azure Container Apps custom container sessions tailored to your needs [28]. Azure Container Apps Code Interpreter Sessions and Custom Container Sessions are well suited for running code generated by agents in a secure and isolated environment. It is a critical component of the architecture to prevent malicious code execution and protect the host system and other users. answer: The baseline architecture for Agentic AI Systems, designed for frameworks like AutoGen, LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Semantic Kernel, is based on the Baseline OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture. It primarily uses Azure Container Apps or Azure Kubernetes Services for deploying agents, orchestrator, API, and prompt flows. A Machine Learning Workspace is integrated for certain models. To efficiently use Azure OpenAI, the service is placed behind an Azure API Management instance for policy application. An optional App Service can be used for the UI. Crucially, an Azure Container Apps environment with serverless code interpreter sessions is deployed outside the workloads network to securely run agent-generated code.
The main components of this architecture are:

Azure AI Studio: A managed cloud service for training, deploying, automating, and managing machine learning models (LLM, SLM, multi-modal models). Its key features include:
Prompt Flow: A development tool for streamlining the Generative AI application lifecycle, supporting creation, testing, and deployment of prompt flows.

Azure API Management: A core architectural component for managing access to Azure OpenAI service, enabling authentication, authorization, monitoring, usage analysis, token limiting, semantic caching (using Azure Cache for Redis), and smart load balancing. Agents interact with Azure OpenAI through this service.
Azure Container Apps: A serverless platform ideal for containerized applications like agents, orchestrators, prompt flows, and backend APIs. It offers auto-scaling and Dapr integration for simple, portable, resilient, and secure microservices and agents. It supports:
Azure Service Bus: For asynchronous communication between agents and orchestrators, providing decoupled messaging via queues and topics.
Dapr service-to-service invocation: For synchronous communication with automatic mTLS authentication, encryption, and service discovery.
Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS): An alternative platform for deploying Dapr or service meshes for direct agent communication.

https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-architecture
summary: This IBM article defines agentic architecture as the structure and design of AI frameworks that automate AI models, emphasizing its role in supporting AI-powered agents through core factors like intentionality and self-reflection. It details various types of agentic architectures (single-agent, multi-agent including vertical, horizontal, and hybrid) and frameworks (reactive, deliberative, cognitive) to achieve autonomous and adaptive AI systems.
Question: How does IBM define agentic architecture and its components?
verbatim: ## What is agentic architecture? Agentic architecture refers to the structure and design of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks. An agentic architecture is one that shapes the virtual space and workflow structure to automate AI models within an agentic AI system. Agentic architecture works to support and regulate the behavior of AI-powered agents working within a generative AI (gen AI) system. Agentic AI systems require its agents to be adaptive and navigate dynamic environments to achieve wanted outcomes. The model is not so different from human psychology‚Äîagency refers to the ability to intentionally make something happen based on one‚Äôs actions. To achieve wanted outcomes, one must use planning, action, memory and reflection. These characteristics align with that of modern AI agents that are used in both single and multi-agent frameworks. It is the goal of the agentic architecture to provide a structure for an LLM to automate agents to complete complex tasks. The autonomous or decision-making behavior of an AI agent depends on the infrastructure that enables it. Agentic architecture is designed to adapt to dynamic environments, enhancing interoperability.

How agentic architecture works
Agentic AI architecture should be composed of components that address the core factors of an agency: Intentionality (planning), forethought, self-reactiveness and self-reflectiveness. These factors provide autonomy to AI agents so that they can set goals, plan, monitor their performance and reflect to reach their specific goal.

Reactive architectures
Reactive architectures map situations directly to actions. They are reflexive, making decisions based on immediate stimuli from the environment rather than drawing on memory or predictive capabilities. They can't learn from the past or plan for the future.

Deliberative architectures
A deliberative architecture is an AI system that makes decisions based on reasoning, planning and internal models of the world. Unlike reactive agents, deliberative agents analyze their environment, predict future outcomes and make informed choices before acting.

Cognitive architectures
A cognitive agentic architecture is an advanced AI system that mimics human-like thinking, reasoning, learning and decision-making. These agents incorporate elements of perception, memory, reasoning and adaptation, each represented by individual modules, enabling them to operate in complex, uncertain environments while improving over time. This is the most advanced type of agentic architecture. A BDI architecture (more commonly referred to as a model or framework) is designed to model rational decision-making in intelligent agents, and it's based on the belief-desire-intention (BDI) framework. This architecture models human-like reasoning in a BDI agent, with:

Beliefs (B): The agent's knowledge of the world, which could include its understanding of the environment, current situation and any sensory data.
Desires (D): The agent's goals or objectives, representing what it wants to achieve. Desires are not necessarily actions but high-level goals.
Intentions (I): The course of action that the agent commits to in order to achieve its desires. Intentions represent planned actions that the agent is actively pursuing, considering its beliefs and desires. answer: IBM defines agentic architecture as "the structure and design of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks." It shapes the virtual space and workflow structure to automate AI models within an agentic AI system. Its purpose is to support and regulate the behavior of AI-powered agents within a generative AI system, providing a structure for large language models (LLMs) to automate agents for complex tasks.
Agentic AI architecture should be composed of components that address the core factors of an agency, which are:

Intentionality (planning)
Forethought
Self-reactiveness
Self-reflectiveness
These factors grant autonomy to AI agents, enabling them to set goals, plan, monitor their performance, and reflect to achieve specific objectives. Furthermore, IBM discusses different agentic frameworks, which can be considered architectural components or approaches:

Reactive architectures: Map situations directly to actions, making decisions based on immediate stimuli without memory or predictive capabilities.
Deliberative architectures: Make decisions based on reasoning, planning, and internal models of the world, analyzing the environment and predicting outcomes before acting.
Cognitive architectures: Advanced AI systems that mimic human-like thinking, reasoning, learning, and decision-making, incorporating elements of perception, memory, reasoning, and adaptation as individual modules. An example is the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture, which models rational decision-making with:

summary: This page details agentic concepts and features supported by LangGraph, defining an agent as an LLM-driven system for controlling application flow. It covers basic architectures like routers, advanced concepts like ReAct (tool calling, memory, planning), and custom features such as human-in-the-loop, parallelization, subgraphs, and reflection for building complex, tailored agent systems.

Agent Types Tools

Question: What agentic concepts and features are provided by LangGraph?
verbatim: Many LLM applications implement a particular control flow of steps before and / or after LLM calls.

Instead of hard-coding a fixed control flow, we sometimes want LLM systems that can pick their own control flow to solve more complex problems! This is one definition of an agent: an agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. There are many ways that an LLM can control application:

An LLM can route between two potential paths
An LLM can decide which of many tools to call
An LLM can decide whether the generated answer is sufficient or more work is needed
Router
A router allows an LLM to select a single step from a specified set of options. This is an agent architecture that exhibits a relatively limited level of control because the LLM usually focuses on making a single decision and produces a specific output from a limited set of pre-defined options. Routers typically employ a few different concepts to achieve this.

Structured Output
Structured outputs with LLMs work by providing a specific format or schema that the LLM should follow in its response. This is similar to tool calling, but more general.

While a router allows an LLM to make a single decision, more complex agent architectures expand the LLM's control in two key ways:

Multi-step decision making: The LLM can make a series of decisions, one after another, instead of just one.
Tool access: The LLM can choose from and use a variety of tools to accomplish tasks.
ReAct is a popular general purpose agent architecture that combines these expansions, integrating three core concepts.

Tool calling: Allowing the LLM to select and use various tools as needed.
Memory: Enabling the agent to retain and use information from previous steps.
Planning: Empowering the LLM to create and follow multi-step plans to achieve goals.
Tool calling
Tools are useful whenever you want an agent to interact with external systems. External systems (e.g., APIs) often require a particular input schema or payload, rather than natural language. When we bind an API, for example, as a tool, we give the model awareness of the required input schema.

Memory
Memory is crucial for agents, enabling them to retain and utilize information across multiple steps of problem-solving. It operates on different scales:

Short-term memory: Allows the agent to access information acquired during earlier steps in a sequence.
Long-term memory: Enables the agent to recall information from previous interactions, such as past messages in a conversation.
LangGraph provides full control over memory implementation:

State: User-defined schema specifying the exact structure of memory to retain.
Checkpointer: Mechanism to store state at every step across different interactions within a session.
Store: Mechanism to store user-specific or application-level data across sessions.
Planning
In a tool-calling agent, an LLM is called repeatedly in a while-loop. At each step the agent decides which tools to call, and what the inputs to those tools should be. Those tools are then executed, and the outputs are fed back into the LLM as observations. The while-loop terminates when the agent decides it has enough information to solve the user request and it is not worth calling any more tools.

Custom agent architectures
While routers and tool-calling agents (like ReAct) are common, customizing agent architectures often leads to better performance for specific tasks. LangGraph offers several powerful features for building tailored agent systems:

Human-in-the-loop
Human involvement can significantly enhance agent reliability, especially for sensitive tasks. This can involve:

Approving specific actions
Providing feedback to update the agent's state
Offering guidance in complex decision-making processes
Parallelization
Parallel processing is vital for efficient multi-agent systems and complex tasks. LangGraph supports parallelization through its Send API, enabling:

Concurrent processing of multiple states
Implementation of map-reduce-like operations
Efficient handling of independent subtasks
Subgraphs
Subgraphs are essential for managing complex agent architectures, particularly in multi-agent systems. They allow:

Isolated state management for individual agents
Hierarchical organization of agent teams
Controlled communication between agents and the main system
Reflection
Reflection mechanisms can significantly improve agent reliability by:

Evaluating task completion and correctness

Providing feedback for iterative improvement

Enabling self-correction and learning answer: LangGraph provides various agentic concepts and features for building intelligent LLM applications:

Agent Definition: An agent is defined as a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application.

LLMs can control applications by: routing between paths, deciding which tools to call, and determining if more work is needed.
Router: An agent architecture where an LLM selects a single step from a specified set of options, offering limited control focused on a single decision.

Structured Output: Essential for routing, it involves providing a specific format or schema for the LLM's response, achievable through prompt engineering, output parsers, or tool calling.
Complex Agent Architectures: Beyond simple routers, these expand LLM control through:

Multi-step Decision Making: The LLM can make a series of sequential decisions.
Tool Access: The LLM can choose from and use a variety of tools.
ReAct Architecture: A popular general-purpose agent architecture combining the following core concepts:

Tool Calling: Allows the LLM to select and use various tools (e.g., APIs) by understanding their required input schemas. LangChain's interface ChatModel.bind_tools(function) supports this.
Memory: Enables the agent to retain and utilize information across multiple steps.
Short-term memory: Accesses information from earlier steps within a sequence.
Long-term memory: Recalls information from previous interactions, such as past messages.
LangGraph's memory implementation control is provided via State (user-defined schema), Checkpointer (stores state at every step), and Store (stores user/application-level data across sessions).
Planning: Involves an LLM repeatedly deciding which tools to call, executing them, feeding outputs back as observations, and terminating when the user request is solved.
Custom Agent Architectures Features (LangGraph specific):

Human-in-the-loop: Integrates human involvement to enhance reliability by allowing approval of actions, feedback for state updates, or guidance in decision-making.
Parallelization: Supports concurrent processing of multiple states through its Send API, enabling map-reduce operations and efficient handling of independent subtasks for multi-agent systems.
Subgraphs: Provides modularity for managing complex multi-agent systems by allowing isolated state management for individual agents, hierarchical organization, and controlled communication between agents and the main system.
Reflection: Mechanisms to improve agent reliability by evaluating task completion, providing feedback for iterative improvement, and enabling self-correction, which can be LLM-based or deterministic.

summary: This page explains how LangGraph models multi-agent systems by treating agents as graph nodes within various architectures, and details how agents communicate through handoffs using the Command object and by managing shared or private state.

Question: How does LangGraph model multi-agent systems and communication?
verbatim: ## Multi-agent systems An agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. As you develop these systems, they might grow more complex over time, making them harder to manage and scale. To tackle these, you might consider breaking your application into multiple smaller, independent agents and composing them into a multi-agent system.

Multi-agent architectures
There are several ways to connect agents in a multi-agent system:

Network: each agent can communicate with every other agent. Any agent can decide which other agent to call next.
Supervisor: each agent communicates with a single supervisor agent. Supervisor agent makes decisions on which agent should be called next.
Supervisor (tool-calling): this is a special case of supervisor architecture. Individual agents can be represented as tools. In this case, a supervisor agent uses a tool-calling LLM to decide which of the agent tools to call, as well as the arguments to pass to those agents.
Hierarchical: you can define a multi-agent system with a supervisor of supervisors. This is a generalization of the supervisor architecture and allows for more complex control flows.
Custom multi-agent workflow: each agent communicates with only a subset of agents. Parts of the flow are deterministic, and only some agents can decide which other agents to call next.
Handoffs
In multi-agent architectures, agents can be represented as graph nodes. Each agent node executes its step(s) and decides whether to finish execution or route to another agent, including potentially routing to itself (e.g., running in a loop). A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is handoffs, where one agent hands off control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify:

destination: target agent to navigate to (e.g., name of the node to go to)
payload: information to pass to that agent (e.g., state update) To implement handoffs in LangGraph, agent nodes can return 
Command
 object that allows you to combine both control flow and state updates.
Communication and state management
The most important thing when building multi-agent systems is figuring out how the agents communicate. A common, generic way for agents to communicate is via a list of messages. This opens up the following questions:

Do agents communicate 
via handoffs or via tool calls
?
What messages are 
passed from one agent to the next
?
How are 
handoffs represented in the list of messages
?
How do you 
manage state for subagents
? Additionally, if you are dealing with more complex agents or wish to keep individual agent state separate from the multi-agent system state, you may need to use 
different state schemas
. answer: LangGraph models multi-agent systems by breaking applications into multiple smaller, independent agents and composing them into a graph. Agents are represented as nodes in this graph. The system's control flow is managed by determining which agent (node) to call next.
LangGraph supports several multi-agent architectures:

Network: Agents are graph nodes, and each agent can communicate with every other agent, deciding which to call next. This is suitable for problems without a clear hierarchy or sequence.
Supervisor: A dedicated supervisor node (LLM) decides which agent nodes to call next. Agents typically route execution back to the supervisor.
Supervisor (tool-calling): A variant of the supervisor architecture where sub-agents are exposed as tools to the supervisor agent. The supervisor uses a tool-calling LLM to decide which tool (sub-agent) to invoke.
Hierarchical: Designed for more complex systems, it involves a supervisor of supervisors, managing specialized teams of agents, each with their own supervisor.
Custom multi-agent workflow: Agents are graph nodes, and their call order is predefined. This can involve explicit control flow via normal graph edges (deterministic) or dynamic control flow using the Command object for LLM-driven decisions.
Communication and state management in LangGraph multi-agent systems are primarily handled through:

Handoffs: Agents pass control and information to other agents. This is achieved by returning a Command object from an agent node, specifying the destination (target agent) and payload (information/state update).
State Management: Communication often occurs via a shared state channel, typically a list of messages. Key considerations include:
Handoffs vs. Tool Calls: Agents communicate via handoffs (passing graph state) or tool call arguments.
Message Passing: Agents can either share the full history of their thought process ("scratchpad") or only share the final result. Sharing full history aids reasoning but can lead to large context; sharing final results is more scalable.
Representing Handoffs: Handoffs are often represented as an AI message with tool calls in the message history, sometimes requiring an additional tool message to indicate successful transfer.
State Management for Subagents: Intermediate messages of subagents can be stored in the shared message list (and filtered) or in a separate message list specific to each subagent.
Different State Schemas: Agents or subgraphs can have distinct state schemas, requiring input/output transformations for communication with the parent graph.

https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-augmented-architect-real-time-enterprise-architecture-in-the-age-of-ai/
summary: This Forrester blog post describes the evolution of Enterprise Architecture (EA) into a real-time, AI-augmented function, moving from static processes to dynamic, closed-loop systems. It frames the augmented architect's role as a curator, facilitator, and critical thinker, empowered by AI to achieve continuous architecture governance and deliver business outcomes, democratizing architectural insights across the enterprise.
Images:
ChatGPT Image Apr 2 2025 09_42_09 AM

Question: How does Forrester frame the augmented architect role?
verbatim: AI augments the architect by continuously updating the repository to expose only fresh data. That means no more digging through stale wikis or emailing 10 teams for basic system lifecycle info. Instead:

Intelligent recommenders augment architecture artifacts with context, rationale, and even business continuity considerations.
Diagram recognition agents convert scanned or even hand-drawn schematics into structured model elements.
Pattern recognition agents detect anti-patterns and optimization opportunities.
Chatbots enable non-architects to interact with the repository, democratizing architecture insight.
Generative agents propose transition roadmaps between current and target states based on actual feasibility, not just aspirational models. This is not just automation its augmentation. Architects remain in the loop, but the loop is smaller, faster, and smarter. Much like GitHub Copilot transformed software engineering improving productivity and satisfaction even in large-scale settings such as ANZ Bank architects will increasingly work alongside copilots of their own. They will define acceptable patterns and reference architectures as they have always done but with the support of LLMs to provide comprehensive, grounded feedback. They will curate the architecture graph, tasking agents with updates and corrections, even large-scale schema refactorings and migrations. (This is not mere speculation. Charlie has had Claude perform complex and error-prone refactorings on his personal graph that would have taken a skilled database administrator hours). They will design guardrails and feedback loops. They ask What are the safe ways to evolve this system? and let the agent generate alternatives within constraints. The architect becomes a curator, facilitator, and, most importantly, a critical thinker in a system where AI can propose but should not dictate. As Stephane notes, Every architect exposed to AI must be trained in critical thinking. There are no more Leonardos but there is now AI. The irony is rich: Architecture, once thought too rigid to keep up with digital change, may now lead it. We are witnessing the rebirth of EA as a living, learning function a system of intelligence powered by feedback loops, driven by data, and guided by augmented human judgment. In that future, architects dont merely draw the map. They design the compass, program the guide, and ensure that the journey stays on course even as the terrain shifts beneath them. answer: Forrester frames the augmented architect role as one where AI serves as a 'sidekick' and 'copilot', significantly enhancing the architect's capabilities rather than replacing them. This augmentation leads to a smaller, faster, and smarter operational loop. Key aspects of this augmented role include:
Augmentation by AI: AI continuously updates the repository with fresh data, eliminating the need for manual data retrieval and ensuring architects have access to current information.
Leveraging Intelligent Agents: Architects utilize intelligent recommenders, diagram recognition agents, pattern recognition agents, chatbots, and generative agents to enhance architectural artifacts, detect anti-patterns, democratize insights, and propose feasible transition roadmaps.
Working with Copilots: Architects will increasingly work alongside AI copilots, similar to how GitHub Copilot assists software engineers.
Defining Patterns and Architectures: They will continue to define acceptable patterns and reference architectures, now with the comprehensive and grounded feedback supported by large language models (LLMs).
Curating the Architecture Graph: Architects curate the architecture graph by tasking agents with updates, corrections, and even large-scale schema refactorings and migrations.
Designing Guardrails and Feedback Loops: They are responsible for designing the guardrails and feedback loops within the AI-driven system.
Prompt Engineering: Architects will act as 'prompt engineers', asking questions to the AI to generate alternatives within constraints, for instance, asking about safe ways to evolve a system.
Curator, Facilitator, and Critical Thinker: The architect becomes a curator of information, a facilitator of processes, and, most importantly, a critical thinker who guides the AI system without being dictated by it.
Steward of Behavioral Systems: The role shifts from merely designing structures to stewarding behavioral systems, focusing on feedback loops.
Guiding the Journey: In the future, architects will not just draw the map but design the compass, program the guide, and ensure the journey stays on course as the terrain changes.

https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/stories/digital-labour-trends-survey-agentic-ai/
Findings from a new study conducted by Salesforce in partnership with NewtonX on adoption of AI agents underlines the strides UK and Ireland companies are making as early adopters of agentic AI.

The quantitative survey of 110 C-suite executives found almost four out of five (78%), across industries and company sizes, are currently using AI agents in their workflow.

Why its important: For the first time, workforces can exceed the bounds of human capability with AI agents working 24/7 to augment and greatly expand productivity, efficiency, innovation, and business competition. Most users in UKI are saving between three and 10 hours per week using AI agents, and expect to realise further productivity gains in the future.

Senior leaders surveyed on how digital labour is reshaping their business say theyre no longer talking about the agentic economy as a coming trend, but a reality.

To ensure this momentum continues, however, in the survey leaders acknowledged that organisational transformation is required, particularly around the need to redeploy talent to support a future workforce with agents and investment in AI-related training.

By the numbers:
AI adoption in the UKI is high, supported by technical infrastructure and employee use.

78% of UKI senior leaders say their organisation currently uses AI agents in their workflow.
62% rate their technical infrastructures adaptability to AI as very good or good.
47% rate their employees adaptability to AI tools as very good or good.
26% expect AI agents to boost productivity across their business.
Senior UKI business leaders anticipate the impact of AI agents will transform their organisational structure and roles.

81% believe AI agents will transform their organisational structure.
91% of leaders say AI agents will enable employee reassignment to relevant new roles.
90% report active executive discussion around AI adoption.
89% agree that integrating AI into workflows will be a critical part of their role.
As AI adoption increases, IT and R&D departments are expected to grow, while customer service and operations are likely to shrink. Skills involving AI collaboration and adaptability will rise, becoming increasingly valuable with AI agents.

65% of UKI senior leaders expect IT departments will grow the most. Other departments expected to grow include R&D (62%) and Sales (41%).
Respondents expect 24% of the workforce to be reassigned to other roles/departments.
Top reassignment areas are technical roles (59%), research and development (50%), and relationship-building roles (49%).
UKI leaders believe human / AI agent collaboration will become the most valuable skill (86%), followed by AI literacy (84%) and adaptability (83%).
Other increasingly valuable skills include creative thinking (69%), problem solving (66%), and AI accountability (61%).
Most organisations plan to train their teams on AI in the next six months to a year.

84% of leaders intend to train employees within the next 12 months.
Leaders intend to invest an average of 12% of a typical employee salary on AI-related retraining.
Only 8% anticipate no investment in reskilling.

https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/
summary: This blog post introduces multi-agent workflows in LangGraph, detailing what multi-agent means, its benefits, and three core examples: Multi Agent Collaboration, Agent Supervisor, and Hierarchical Agent Teams, along with a third-party application example (GPT-Newspaper). It also briefly compares LangGraph to other frameworks like Autogen and CrewAI.

Diagram of Multi Agent Collaboration Workflow Diagram of Agent Supervisor Workflow

Question: Any example architectures or patterns highlighted?
verbatim: We've added three separate example of multi-agent workflows to the langgraph repo. Each of these has slightly different answers for the above two questions, which we will go over when we highlight the examples.

Multi Agent Collaboration
In this example, the different agents collaborate on a shared scratchpad of messages. This means that all the work either of them do is visible to the other. We call this collaboration because of the shared nature the scratchpad. What are the multiple independent agents? In this case, the independent agents are actually just a single LLM call. Specifically, they are a specific prompt template (to format inputs in a specific way with a specific system message) plus an LLM call. How are those agents connected? The main thing controlling the state transitions is the router, but it is a rule-based router and so is rather quite simple. Basically, after each LLM call it looks at the output. If a tool is invoked, then it calls that tool. If no tool is called and the LLM responds "FINAL ANSWER" then it returns to the user. Otherwise (if no tool is called and the LLM does not respond "FINAL ANSWER") then it goes to the other LLM.

Agent Supervisor
In this example, multiple agents are connected, but compared to above they do NOT share a shared scratchpad. Rather, they have their own independent scratchpads, and then their final responses are appended to a global scratchpad. What are the multiple independent agents? In this case, the independent agents are a LangChain agent. This means they have their own individual prompt, LLM, and tools. When called, it's not just a single LLM call, but rather a run of the AgentExecutor. How are those agents connected? An agent supervisor is responsible for routing to individual agents. In this way, the supervisor can also be thought of an agent whose tools are other agents!

Hierarchical Agent Teams
This is similar to the above example, but now the agents in the nodes are actually other langgraph objects themselves. This provides even more flexibility than using LangChain AgentExecutor as the agent runtime. We call this hierarchical teams because the subagents can in a way be thought of as teams. What are the multiple independent agents? These are now other langgraph agents. How are those agents connected? A supervisor agent connects them.

Third Party Applications
As part of this launch, we're also excited to highlight a few applications built on top of LangGraph that utilize the concept of multiple agents.

GPT-Newspaper
GPT-Newspaper is an innovative autonomous agent designed to create personalized newspapers tailored to user preferences. The architecture consists of six specialized sub-agents. There is one key step - a writer <> critique loop which adds in a helpful cycle. answer: The blog post highlights three core multi-agent workflow examples/patterns built with LangGraph, and one third-party application example:

Multi Agent Collaboration: Agents share a common scratchpad for messages. Each independent agent is essentially a single LLM call with a specific prompt template. Agents are connected via a rule-based router that directs flow based on LLM output (tool invocation, "FINAL ANSWER", or passing to the other LLM).
Agent Supervisor: Agents do not share a scratchpad; they maintain independent ones, and their final responses are added to a global scratchpad. Each independent agent is a LangChain agent with its own prompt, LLM, and tools, running an AgentExecutor. An agent supervisor routes tasks to individual agents, acting as an agent whose tools are other agents.
Hierarchical Agent Teams: Similar to the Agent Supervisor pattern, but the independent agents within the nodes are themselves other langgraph objects, providing greater flexibility. A supervisor agent connects these langgraph sub-agents, forming hierarchical teams.
GPT-Newspaper: A third-party application example that uses a multi-agent architecture. It consists of six specialized sub-agents and includes a writer-critique loop.
