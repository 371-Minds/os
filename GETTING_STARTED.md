## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Made Easy**

### **"The Setup Failed!"**
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+

# Check permissions
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run with debug info
DEBUG=* ./scripts/quick-start.sh
```

### **"Agents Won't Start!"**
```bash
# Check environment
cat .env

# Verify build
bun run build

# Check ports
netstat -tulpn | grep :3000
```

### **"Akash Deployment Issues!"**
```bash
# Check wallet balance
akash query bank balances $(akash keys show main -a)

# Verify SDL file
akash validate deployment/akash/deploy.yml

# Check provider status
akash query market provider list
```
