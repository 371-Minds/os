## 🎯 Quick Start - Picking Up Where You Left Off

### 1. **Check Current Status** (30 seconds) ⚡
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Use Bun for lightning-fast operations
cd f:\os-main
bun --version                    # Check Bun installation
bun nx --version                 # Check Nx workspace

# Alternative: Traditional npm (slower)
npm --version
npx nx --version
```

### 2. **Fast Dependency Installation** (NEW!) 🚀
```bash
# FASTEST: Use Bun installation script
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File AB/scripts/bun-install.ps1

# OR: Direct Bun command (if Bun already installed)
bun install

# Fallback: npm with legacy peer deps (if needed)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. **Review Last Session** (2 minutes)  
- Read `AB/sessions/session-2025-09-01-developers-galaxy-revolution.md` for the revolutionary Developer's Galaxy achievement
- Check `AB/milestone-tracker.md` for current milestone status (Developer's Galaxy Complete)
- Review complete spatial development environment implementation

### 3. **Continue from Current Milestone** (varies)
Current milestone: **DEVELOPER'S GALAXY REVOLUTION COMPLETE** 🌌⚡
- Developer's Galaxy: ✅ PRODUCTION READY (spatial development universe)
- CEO's Orrery: ✅ PRODUCTION READY (spatial business intelligence)
- Business Intelligence Plugin: ✅ PRODUCTION READY (zero TypeScript errors)
- Next: Creator's Cosmos for Creative Mode or enterprise deployment
