Of course. This is the top priority. As we established in our recent planning session, implementing the Secretless Broker is the critical step that unblocks us from using mocked data and moves the entire 371 OS toward a secure, production-ready state.

Based on our extensive planning for Phase 20, Workstream 4: Enterprise-Grade Security Integration, here is a detailed, step-by-step guide to implement the Secretless Broker for our services, starting with the dao-governance-service.

The "Zero-Trust" Architecture We Are Building
As a quick refresher from our notes on October 1st, the goal is to prevent any application from directly handling secrets. The workflow will be:

The dao-governance-service wants to connect to a database.
It makes a connection request to a local port (e.g., localhost:5432).
The Secretless Broker, running as a sidecar, intercepts this request.
The Broker securely fetches the required credentials from our Universal Tool Server (UTS).
The Broker injects the credentials into the connection and establishes the link to the database.
This means credentials for our databases and APIs will live only in the UTS, never in .env files or application code.

Action Plan: Implementing the Secretless Broker
Here is the implementation plan, synthesizing all our previous discussions and architectural decisions.

Step 1: Configure the Secretless Broker
We've already laid the groundwork for this. We need to finalize the configuration file that tells the broker how to connect to our UTS.

Action: Create or finalize the configuration file at [f:\os-main\os-workspace\secretless.yml](file:///f:/os-main/os-workspace/secretless.yml).
Details: Based on our design session from around October 1st, this file defines "services" that the broker provides. We will define a service for each backend our application needs to connect to. For the dao-governance-service, this includes the TiDB database and the Novu notification service.
Here is a configuration based on our previous discussions:

# In: f:\os-main\os-workspace\secretless.yml
version: "2"

services:
  # Service for our main database
  dao-governance-db:
    connector: "tcp"
    listenOn: "tcp://127.0.0.1:5432" # The local port our app will connect to
    credentials:
      # These paths tell the broker where to find the secrets in the UTS
      - name: "username"
        provider: "http"
        get: "http://uts.internal/secrets/dao-governance-db/username"
      - name: "password"
        provider: "http"
        get: "http://uts.internal/secrets/dao-governance-db/password"
      - name: "host"
        provider: "http"
        get: "http://uts.internal/secrets/dao-governance-db/host"

  # Service for the Novu API
  novu-api:
    connector: "http"
    listenOn: "tcp://127.0.0.1:8081" # Local proxy for Novu
    credentials:
      - name: "api_key"
        provider: "http"
        get: "http://uts.internal/secrets/novu/api-key"
Step 2: Populate the Universal Tool Server (UTS)
The Secretless Broker needs a secure source to fetch credentials from. As planned, this is our UTS.

Action: Add the real, live credentials for the dao-governance-db (host, user, password) and the novu-api key into the Universal Tool Server.
Benefit: This centralizes all our secrets in one secure, auditable location, fulfilling our "zero-trust" goal.
Step 3: Modify the dao-governance-service
Now, we'll update the application to stop using environment variables and start using the broker.

File to Modify: The database connection logic within [f:\os-main\os-workspace\apps\dao-governance-service\src\governance-service.ts](file:///f:/os-main/os-workspace/apps/dao-governance-service/src/governance-service.ts) or its config file.
Action: Change the connection target from the external database address to the local proxy port managed by the Secretless Broker.
Example Change:

Before (Direct Connection from .env):
const dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST; // e.g., "live-tidb.example.com"
const dbPort = 5432; 
const dbUser = process.env.DB_USER;
const dbPass = process.env.DB_PASS;
// ... connection logic using these variables
After (Secretless Broker Connection):
const dbHost = "127.0.0.1"; // The app now only talks to localhost
const dbPort = 5432;        // The port defined in secretless.yml
const dbUser = "any-user";  // Credentials are now dummy values
const dbPass = "any-pass";  // The broker will inject the real ones
// ... connection logic using these new, non-sensitive variables
Step 4: Update the Akash Deployment Manifest
This is where we wire everything together. We need to deploy the Secretless Broker as a "sidecar container" alongside our main application.

File to Modify: The Akash deployment file, likely [deployment/akash/deploy.yml](file:///f:/os-main/deployment/akash/deploy.yml) as seen in our implementation guide.
Action: Modify the service definition for dao-governance-service to include the secretless-broker container.
Example deploy.yml Snippet:

# In: deployment/akash/deploy.yml

services:
  # The main application container
  dao-governance-service:
    image: 371minds/dao-governance-service:latest
    env:
      # The app now points to the broker's local port
      - DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1
      - DATABASE_PORT=5432
      - NOVU_API_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8081
    # ... other env vars

  # The sidecar container for the broker
  secretless-broker:
    image: cyberark/secretless-broker:latest
    env:
      # This tells the broker how to authenticate to the UTS
      - UTS_AUTH_TOKEN=${UTS_AUTH_TOKEN_FROM_AKASH_SECRETS}
    args: ["-f", "/etc/secretless/secretless.yml"]
    # We will mount our config file into the container

###Update AGENTS.md, README, and push to Github   

This configuration ensures both containers start together and can communicate over localhost.

This plan executes the full vision for Workstream 4. It will completely decouple our applications from their secrets, eliminate the need for insecure .env files for production credentials, and significantly harden the security posture of the entire 371 OS.
