## Project Overview

371 OS is a revolutionary Autonomous Agent Operating System designed to overcome limitations of traditional Model Context Protocol (MCP) systems through blockchain-based Universal Tool Servers. It enables true agent autonomy with significant cost reductions.

## Key Components

- **Universal Tool Server Architecture**: Stateless, blockchain-based agent coordination
- **Self-Aware Agents**: Agents that understand and manipulate their own workspace
- **Cost Optimization**: 97.6% cost reduction through Akash Network deployment
- **Decentralized Registry**: Blockchain-based agent discovery with cryptographic trust
- **Enterprise Security**: Zero-trust architecture with Secretless Broker and ACI.dev
- **Economic Incentives**: Stake-based reputation system for agent reliability
