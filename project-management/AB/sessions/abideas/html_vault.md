Store a secret securely in a standalone HTML file. Encrypts any message/secret and generates something that can decrypt itself. I see mainly two advantages of this HTML-based solution over others:

low entry-barrier – Everyone with a reasonably modern browser will be able to use the tool, without installing anything. It is also more platform-independent than other solutions.
self-contained – The generated self-decrypting page contains all the logic it needs to decrypt the encrypted messages it contains. It can be easily stored as a file and requires no further tooling (which might break or change) to work.
Uses self-decrypting-html-page under the hood. https://github.com/derhuerst/self-decrypting-html-page#self-decrypting-html-page

I'll check out the thi.ng project to understand what it is and its potential use cases.Based on the thi.ng project, here are some key use cases for this comprehensive computational design toolkit:

Core Use Cases

Generative Art & Creative Coding

Browser-based generative art projects with platform-specific support (fx(hash), etc.)
Interactive visualizations and animations
Procedural graphics and pattern generation

Data Visualization & Processing

Complex data transformations using functional programming patterns
Interactive charts, graphs, and visual analytics
Real-time data streaming and reactive programming

Computational Design & Architecture

2D/3D geometry processing and manipulation
Parametric design tools and workflows
Digital fabrication and CAD-like operations

Game Development & Graphics

WebGL-based rendering and shader programming
Physics simulations and particle systems
Audio synthesis and DSP processing

Scientific Computing

Mathematical operations and algorithms
Cellular automata and evolutionary systems
Signal processing and analysis
Industry Applications

The project has been successfully used across:

Architecture & Product Design - parametric modeling, digital fabrication
Data Visualization - interactive dashboards, analytics tools
Motion Graphics/VFX - procedural animations, visual effects
Audio Production - synthesis, DSP, music generation
Art Installations - interactive exhibits, generative displays
Game Development - procedural content, physics simulations
Technical Strengths
210 TypeScript packages with minimal dependencies
Functional programming approach with emphasis on composition
Cross-platform support (browser, Node.js, embedded devices)
Modular architecture - use only what you need
Rich ecosystem covering geometry, graphics, audio, data structures, and more

Perfect for developers working on creative coding, data visualization, or computational design projects who want a mature, well-documented toolkit with a functional programming approach.
