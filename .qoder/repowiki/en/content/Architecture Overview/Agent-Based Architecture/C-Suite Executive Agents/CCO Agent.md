## Introduction

The CCO (Customer Experience Officer) Agent is a specialized autonomous agent within the 371 OS ecosystem responsible for monitoring and maintaining customer experience quality across all touchpoints. It functions as a customer experience officer by continuously evaluating customer sentiment, identifying potential pain points, and triggering appropriate interventions to ensure user satisfaction and retention. The agent operates on a scheduled monitoring cycle, analyzing customer health metrics and taking automated actions when thresholds are breached.

## Core Responsibilities

The CCO Agent's primary function is customer experience monitoring, which involves periodic evaluation of a customer health score. The agent follows a defined workflow to assess customer well-being and respond to emerging issues:

1. **Monitoring Initiation**: The agent begins its monitoring cycle by checking the current customer health score.
2. **Score Evaluation**: The health score is evaluated against a threshold of 0.8.
3. **Healthy State Response**: If the score exceeds 0.8, the agent waits for one hour before conducting the next check.
4. **Warning State Response**: If the score is 0.8 or below, the agent initiates a response plan that includes sentiment analysis, issue creation, and stakeholder notification.

end
```

## Architecture and Integration

The CCO Agent is implemented as a Python class that inherits from the `ImprovedBaseAgent` and is designed to work within the 371 OS agent framework. It integrates with multiple platform components to fulfill its customer experience responsibilities.

### AnyChat Platform Integration

The CCO Agent leverages the AnyChat platform for customer communication through the `AnyChatConnector` class. This integration enables the agent to create dedicated customer spaces and deploy C-Suite agents for specialized functions.

```python
class AnyChatConnector:
    """AnyChat platform integration for customer communication management"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_base = "https://api.anychat.com/v1"
        self.api_token = os.environ.get('ANYCHAT_API_TOKEN')
        
    async def create_community_space(self, community_config: dict) -> dict:
        """Creates dedicated AnyChat space for customer community"""
        space_config = {
            "name": f"371OS-{community_config['niche']}",
            "description": community_config['description'],
            "privacy": "invite_only",
            "features": {
                "pay_what_you_can": True,
                "contribution_tracking": True,
                "mini_apps": community_config.get('enabled_mini_apps', [])
            }
        }
        
        response = await self._make_api_request('POST', '/spaces', space_config)
        return response
    
    async def deploy_agent_integrations(self, space_id: str, agent_configs: list) -> dict:
        """Deploy C-Suite agents to AnyChat space"""
        deployed_agents = []
        for agent_config in agent_configs:
            agent_integration = await self._deploy_agent(space_id, agent_config)
            deployed_agents.append(agent_integration)
            
        return {"deployed_agents": deployed_agents, "space_id": space_id}
```

### Email System Integration

The CCO Agent coordinates with the email automation system through the ResendService for customer communications. The service enables agent notifications, business alerts, and email campaign management.

```typescript
interface CommunicationCoordinationEvent {
  id: string;
  type: 'agent_notification' | 'status_update' | 'alert_trigger' | 'coordination_request';
  agentType: 'CEO' | 'CFO' | 'CTO' | 'CMO' | 'CLO' | 'CCO';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  message: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  timestamp: Date;
}

async sendAgentNotification(
  agentType: CommunicationCoordinationEvent['agentType'],
  message: string,
  priority: CommunicationCoordinationEvent['priority'] = 'medium',
  metadata?: Record<string, any>,
): Promise<string>
```

## Sentiment Analysis and Proactive Intervention

The CCO Agent utilizes sentiment analysis as a core component of its customer experience monitoring functionality. When the customer health score falls below the threshold, the agent initiates a sentiment analysis process on recent customer interactions to identify negative sentiment patterns.

### Adaptive LLM Router Integration

The agent leverages the Adaptive LLM Router system to process sentiment analysis tasks. The Intelligent Router Agent evaluates incoming requests and routes them to appropriate specialized agents based on task requirements.

```python
async def process_task(self, task: Task) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    self.logger.info(f"CCO Agent is analyzing task: {task.description}")

    task_description = task.description.lower()

    if "customer health" in task_description:
        action_plan = [
            "1. Analyze recent interactions for negative sentiment.",
            "2. Create 'Review Customer Health' issue in YouTrack.",
            "3. Notify CEO Agent of 'Warning' status."
        ]

        return {
            "status": "action_plan_generated",
            "message": "Customer health score is below threshold. Executing response plan.",
            "plan": action_plan
        }
```

The routing decision is based on policy rules that consider task criticality, privacy requirements, and resource availability. This ensures that sentiment analysis tasks are processed by the most appropriate LLM provider given the current system constraints.

## Coordination with CMO and CRO Agents

The CCO Agent works in coordination with other business agents to ensure journey consistency across customer touchpoints. This collaboration enables a unified approach to customer experience management.

### CMO Agent Integration

The CCO Agent shares customer feedback insights with the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) Agent to inform marketing strategies. This coordination ensures that customer sentiment is reflected in marketing campaigns and communication strategies.

### CRO Agent Integration

Customer retention insights from the CCO Agent are shared with the CRO (Chief Revenue Officer) Agent to optimize revenue generation strategies. This integration helps align customer experience improvements with business growth objectives.
