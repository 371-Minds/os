# Migration Summary: ESLint + Prettier to Biome

## Overview
We've successfully migrated from ESLint + Prettier to Biome to significantly reduce our dependency count and improve performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Biome
- Installed `@biomejs/biome` as a dev dependency
- Created `biome.json` configuration file

### 2. Updated Scripts
- Replaced `"lint": "bun nx run-many -t lint"` with `"lint": "bunx @biomejs/biome check --write ."`
- Added `"format": "bunx @biomejs/biome format --write ."`

### 3. Removed Dependencies
Removed the following packages from devDependencies:
- `eslint`
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- `@typescript-eslint/parser`
- `eslint-config-prettier`
- `prettier`
- `@nx/eslint`
- `@nx/eslint-plugin`
- `jsonc-eslint-parser`

### 4. Documentation
- Created `BIOME_MIGRATION.md` to document the migration process
- Updated `README.md` to include information about the migration

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Dependency Count**: Eliminated hundreds of dependencies
2. **Faster Execution**: Biome is significantly faster than ESLint + Prettier
3. **Simplified Configuration**: One tool instead of multiple tools
4. **Better Performance**: Written in Rust for optimal performance

## Current Status

- ✅ Biome is properly installed and configured
- ✅ Linting command works (`bun run lint`)
- ✅ Formatting command works (`bun run format`)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Dependencies removed

## Next Steps

1. Consider running `bun install` to regenerate the lockfile without the removed dependencies
2. Consider adding Biome configuration to ignore certain files or directories if needed
3. Consider adding more specific rules to the Biome configuration as needed
