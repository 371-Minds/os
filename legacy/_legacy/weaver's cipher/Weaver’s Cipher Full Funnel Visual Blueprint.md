🌌 Weaver’s Cipher Full Funnel Visual Blueprint
1. Ad Creative Concepts
A. Microsoft Search Ads (Text-Only)

Minimalist, cryptic — no “job ad” language. Just whispers.

Example Ad #1

Headline 1: The Cipher Awaits

Headline 2: A Puzzle Beyond Code

Headline 3: Invitation Only

Description: Not a test. A resonance. Begin the unraveling. The invitation hides behind the veil.

Design Cue for Visual Teams:

No stock photos.

Black or dark indigo background.

Subtle glowing geometric weave/circuit pattern.

B. Audience / Display Ads (Visual)

Format: 1200×628 (LinkedIn / Display standard)

Imagery:

A weaving pattern glowing like circuitry.

Almost black background.

Subtle ambient glow.

Text Overlay:

“We build new tables, not ask for a seat at the old ones.”

CTA: [Begin the Unraveling]

C. LinkedIn Targeted Ads

Audience: Women in Tech, Engineers, Philosophical Coders.

Ad Visual Concept:

Headline overlay: For Visionary Builders Only

Subtext overlay: Not a test. A resonance.

Background: Faint Kente-inspired weave + circuit schematic (abstract, not literal).

CTA Button: Enter the Veil

2. Landing Page Flow Mockup
Step 1: The Veil (Entry Point)

Visual:

Black screen with a faint, pulsing geometric weave.

After 5s → Text fades in: “We build new tables, not ask for a seat at the old ones.”

CTA: [Begin the Unraveling] (not a button, but an instruction — user must click text).

Step 2: The Unraveling (Interactive Test)

Phases (from your concept):

The Loom (choose missing thread → reveals mindset).

The Resonance (audio dissonance puzzle → reveals problem-solving style).

The Cipher (open-ended principle input → reveals core philosophy).

Design Cues:

Abstract UI, not gamified.

Monochrome + faint neon accents (teal, violet).

Subtle ambient sound.

Step 3: The Invitation (Payoff)

Result Screen:

The complete pattern (personalized).

Harmonized soundscape.

Message Lines (fade in sequentially):

“The pattern is recognized.”

“The frequency is matched.”

“The cipher is waiting.”

Final CTA (Trick):

Instruction: “Send an empty email to cipher@371minds.com
. Subject line must be the hex code of the primary color in your pattern.”

3. Retargeting & Email Flow
A. Retargeting Ads (for drop-offs)

Whisper reminders across LinkedIn + Audience Network:

“The pattern is unfinished.”

“Your resonance is incomplete.”

“Return to the cipher.”

Visuals: Faded pattern, missing piece, pulsing glow.

B. Email Autoresponder Flow

Immediate Response (after email sent)

Subject: The Pattern Is Recognized

Body:

Line 1: “The frequency is matched.”

Line 2: “Your cipher awaits.”

CTA: Private link → hidden calendar or encrypted chat.

48-Hour Reminder (if they don’t click through)

Subject: The Cipher Remembers

Body:

“You left the unraveling incomplete. The invitation still stands.”

Final Email (72 hours)

Subject: The Last Thread

Body:

“Complete the pattern, or let it fade.”

CTA: Private link again.
