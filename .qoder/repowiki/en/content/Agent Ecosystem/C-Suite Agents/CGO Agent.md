### Task Processing Workflow

The CGO Agent processes tasks through a structured workflow that ensures reliability and performance. When a task is submitted, it enters a priority-based queue and is processed by worker threads that handle execution, monitoring, and error recovery.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User as "User/System"
participant CGO as "CGO Agent"
participant Worker as "Worker Process"
participant LLM as "Adaptive LLM Router"
User->>CGO : submit_task(Task)
CGO->>CGO : add_task to queue
loop Worker Loop
Worker->>CGO : get_task from queue
Worker->>CGO : mark task as active
alt Task Type
CGO->>CGO : analyze_community_growth()
CGO->>LLM : llm_invoke_with_pooling()
LLM-->>CGO : strategic insights
CGO->>CGO : generate growth analysis
else
CGO->>CGO : trigger_community_scaling()
CGO->>CGO : execute scaling action
end
CGO->>CGO : update task status
CGO->>CGO : record metrics
CGO->>User : return task result
end
```

### Growth Analysis Implementation

The analyze_community_growth method is the primary analytical function of the CGO Agent, responsible for evaluating community metrics and identifying growth opportunities. In the current implementation, this is a mock function that simulates analysis, but in a production environment, it would integrate with analytics systems to process real community data.

```python
async def analyze_community_growth(self, community_data: dict) -> dict:
    """Analyzes community metrics for growth opportunities"""
    # This is a mock implementation since the analytics and koog parts are not fully available
    # In a real scenario, this would involve complex logic.
    await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simulate async work
    return {
        "status": "analysis_complete",
        "insights": "mocked_insights"
    }
```

This method would typically analyze metrics such as user engagement, retention rates, conversion funnels, and community health indicators to generate actionable growth insights.

**Section sources**
- [cgo_agent.py](file://_legacy\agents\business\cgo_agent.py#L40-L48)

### Community Scaling Implementation

The trigger_community_scaling method executes growth initiatives based on strategic decisions. Currently, it supports spawning subcommunities as a scaling action, integrating with Space Automation and AnyChat systems to create new community instances.

```python
async def trigger_community_scaling(self, scaling_decision: dict) -> dict:
    """Executes community scaling through Space Automation"""
    # This is a mock implementation
    await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simulate async work
    if scaling_decision.get('action') == 'spawn_subcommunity':
        return {
            "status": "scaling_initiated",
            "space_automation": "mocked_space_result",
            "anychat_integration": "mocked_anychat_space"
        }
    return {"status": "no_action_taken"}
```

This function represents the execution layer of growth strategies, where analytical insights are translated into concrete scaling actions.

## Integration with Adaptive LLM Router

The CGO Agent integrates with the Adaptive LLM Router through the ImprovedBaseAgent's llm_invoke_with_pooling method, which provides optimized LLM access for growth-related tasks. This integration enables the CGO Agent to leverage multiple LLM providers based on cost, performance, and capability requirements.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant CGO as "CGO Agent"
participant Base as "ImprovedBaseAgent"
participant Pool as "Connection Pool"
participant ALR as "Adaptive LLM Router"
participant LLM as "LLM Provider"
CGO->>Base : llm_invoke_with_pooling(prompt, meta)
Base->>Base : Generate cache key
alt Cache Hit
Base-->>CGO : Return cached result
else Cache Miss
Base->>Pool : Get connection
Pool-->>Base : Connection
Base->>ALR : invoke(prompt, meta, user_id)
ALR->>ALR : select_provider(meta, input_tokens, output_tokens)
ALR->>LLM : Make LLM call
LLM-->>ALR : Response
ALR-->>Base : Response
Base->>Base : Cache result
Base->>Pool : Return connection
Base-->>CGO : Return LLM response
end
```

**Diagram sources**

- [llm.py](file://_legacy\adaptive_llm_router\llm.py#L30-L42)

The integration works as follows:
1. The CGO Agent calls llm_invoke_with_pooling with a prompt and metadata
2. The method checks the cache for a previously computed result
3. If not cached, it acquires a connection from the pool
4. It enriches the metadata with agent-specific information
5. It invokes the Adaptive LLM Router with the prompt and metadata
6. The router selects the optimal LLM provider based on the metadata and cost/performance policies
7. The response is cached (if caching is enabled) and returned to the CGO Agent

This architecture enables cost-effective, reliable, and high-performance LLM usage for growth strategy formulation and analysis.

## Coordination with CMO Agent

The CGO Agent coordinates with the CMO Agent (Chief Monetization Officer) to align growth strategies with monetization initiatives. While the current codebase shows separate implementations, the architecture suggests a collaborative relationship where the CGO Agent focuses on user acquisition and community growth, while the CMO Agent optimizes revenue generation and advertising campaigns.

```mermaid
graph TD
A[CGO Agent] --> |Growth Strategy| B[CMO Agent]
B --> |Monetization Data| A
A --> C[User Acquisition]
A --> D[Community Growth]
B --> E[Pricing Optimization]
B --> F[Advertising Campaigns]
C --> G[Increased User Base]
G --> E
D --> H[Engaged Community]
H --> F
```

- [cmo_agent.py](file://_legacy\agents\business\cmo_agent.py#L6-L68)

The CMO Agent implements specific monetization capabilities:
- **Pricing Optimization**: Analyzes community contribution patterns and adjusts Pay-What-You-Can pricing suggestions
- **Advertising Management**: Monitors and optimizes advertising campaigns across multiple platforms

The CGO Agent would likely provide user acquisition data and growth forecasts to inform the CMO Agent's pricing and advertising strategies, creating a feedback loop between growth and monetization.

## Performance and Reliability Features

The CGO Agent inherits a comprehensive set of performance and reliability features from the ImprovedBaseAgent, ensuring stable and efficient operation in production environments.

### Task Queue and Concurrency Control

The agent uses a priority-based task queue with concurrency control to manage multiple growth tasks efficiently:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[New Task] --> B{Priority Queue}
B --> C[High Priority Tasks]
B --> D[Medium Priority Tasks]
B --> E[Low Priority Tasks]
C --> F[Semaphore: Max Concurrent Tasks]
D --> F
E --> F
F --> G[Worker Processes]
G --> H[Task Execution]
H --> I[Result Processing]
I --> J[Metrics Update]
```

**Diagram sources**
- [improved_base_agent.py](file://_legacy\agents\base_agent\improved_base_agent.py#L200-L250)

### Caching System

The CGO Agent employs a TTL-based caching system to avoid redundant computations and reduce LLM invocation costs:

```python
class SimpleCache:
    """Simple TTL cache for agent responses"""
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 1000, ttl_seconds: int = 3600):
        self.cache: Dict[str, tuple] = {}  # key: (value, expiry_time)
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.ttl_seconds = ttl_seconds
        self.access_times = deque()
        
    def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[Any]:
        """Get value from cache"""
        if key in self.cache:
            value, expiry_time = self.cache[key]
            if time.time() < expiry_time:
                return value
            else:
                # Expired
                del self.cache[key]
        return None
```

**Section sources**
- [improved_base_agent.py](file://_legacy\agents\base_agent\improved_base_agent.py#L100-L150)

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The agent implements a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when external services are unavailable:

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Simple circuit breaker for external API calls"""
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, timeout: int = 60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.is_open = False
    
    def can_execute(self) -> bool:
        """Check if circuit breaker allows execution"""
        if not self.is_open:
            return True
            
        if self.last_failure_time and (time.time() - self.last_failure_time) > self.timeout:
            self.is_open = False
            self.failure_count = 0
            return True
            
        return False
```

**Section sources**
- [improved_base_agent.py](file://_legacy\agents\base_agent\improved_base_agent.py#L150-L180)

### Performance Metrics Collection

The agent continuously monitors its performance through a comprehensive metrics system:

```python
@dataclass
class PerformanceMetrics:
    """Agent performance metrics"""
    tasks_completed: int = 0
    tasks_failed: int = 0
    total_processing_time: float = 0.0
    avg_response_time: float = 0.0
    current_memory_mb: float = 0.0
