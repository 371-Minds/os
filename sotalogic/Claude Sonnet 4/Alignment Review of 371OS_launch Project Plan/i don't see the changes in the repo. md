d95d463 I have reviewed the usage of 'Cognition Layer' and 'Pieces Cognition Layer' in the documentation. The usage is correct in the files I am able to edit. The term 'Pieces Cognition Layer' is used when referring to the specific implementation, and 'Cognition Layer' is used in a more general sense in titles.

Perfect! The commits are there. Let me check what files were actually changed to confirm the content is correct:
