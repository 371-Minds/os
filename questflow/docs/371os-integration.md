# 371OS Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to integrate QuestFlow with the 371OS Autonomous Agent Operating System. QuestFlow serves as a workflow orchestration layer that can coordinate the specialized agents and plugins of 371OS.

## Architecture Integration

QuestFlow integrates with 371OS at multiple levels:

1. **Agent Layer**: Direct integration with C-Suite agents (CEO, CTO, CFO, etc.)
2. **Plugin Layer**: Orchestration of ElizaOS plugins
3. **Blockchain Layer**: Interaction with the decentralized agent registry
4. **Deployment Layer**: Coordination of Akash Network deployments

## Prerequisites

1. 371OS repository cloned and set up
2. Bun package manager installed (required for 371OS)
3. Nx workspace properly configured
4. ElizaOS plugins built and available

## Configuration

### 1. Update Configuration File

Modify `config/default.json` to point to your 371OS installation:

```json
{
  "integration": {
    "elizaos": {
      "pluginsPath": "../os-workspace/packages",
      "agentsPath": "../os-workspace/agents"
    },
    "blockchain": {
      "registryAddress": "YOUR_REGISTRY_ADDRESS",
      "network": "ethereum"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Agent Configuration

QuestFlow agents are configured to work with 371OS agents. The configuration files in `agents/core/` and `agents/specialized/` should match the capabilities of the corresponding 371OS agents.

## Core Integration Components

### Agent Registry (`lib/agent-registry.js`)

The agent registry provides functions for:
- Loading agent configurations from 371OS
- Listing available agents
- Validating agent configurations

### Plugin Manager (`lib/plugin-manager.js`)

The plugin manager handles:
- Loading ElizaOS plugins
- Executing plugin actions
- Managing plugin dependencies

### Blockchain Client (`lib/blockchain-client.js`)

The blockchain client enables:
- Interaction with the 371OS blockchain registry
- Agent registration and discovery
- Reputation score management

### Akash Deployer (`lib/akash-deployer.js`)

The Akash deployer provides:
- Deployment of workflows to Akash Network
- Cost optimization features
- Deployment monitoring

## Workflow Integration

### C-Suite Orchestration

QuestFlow can orchestrate the C-Suite agents of 371OS:

1. **CEO (Mimi)**: Strategic decision making
2. **CTO (Zara)**: Technical implementation oversight
3. **CFO (Maya)**: Financial analysis and optimization
4. **CLO (Alex)**: Legal and compliance considerations
5. **CMO (Anova)**: Marketing and growth strategies

### Plugin Development Workflow

Automate the development and deployment of ElizaOS plugins:

1. Planning phase with CTO agent
2. Implementation by technical agents
3. Testing with test agents
4. Deployment through Universal Tool Server

### Business Intelligence Analysis

Leverage the business intelligence capabilities:

1. Data collection from various sources
2. Trend analysis and pattern recognition
3. Alert generation for anomalies
4. Performance evaluation of departments

## API Integration

### ElizaOS Core Connector

The ElizaOS core connector (`connectors/elizaos-core-connector.json`) provides endpoints for:

- Loading agent configurations
- Executing plugin actions
- Building projects with Nx

### Blockchain Registry Connector

The blockchain registry connector enables:

- Agent registration
- Agent discovery
- Reputation management

### Akash Network Connector

The Akash connector provides:

- Deployment initiation
- Cost monitoring
- Resource management

## Best Practices

### 1. Agent Configuration

Ensure agent configurations in QuestFlow match the capabilities of 371OS agents:

```json
{
  "name": "ceo-mimi",
  "provider": "elizaos",
  "capabilities": [
    "strategic-planning",
    "cost-optimization",
    "high-level-coordination"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "business-intelligence",
    "nx-workspace"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Workflow Design

Design workflows that leverage the strengths of 371OS:

- Use C-Suite agents for strategic decisions
- Leverage specialized agents for specific tasks
- Incorporate business intelligence for data-driven decisions
- Utilize self-awareness capabilities for workspace manipulation

### 3. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling that accounts for:

- Network issues with blockchain interactions
- Plugin compatibility issues
- Agent availability problems
- Deployment failures on Akash Network

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests for integration components:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration Tests

Run integration tests that interact with 371OS:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

## Deployment

### Development Environment

1. Set up 371OS in development mode
2. Configure QuestFlow to point to development 371OS
3. Run integration tests

### Production Environment

1. Deploy 371OS to Akash Network
2. Configure QuestFlow for production 371OS
3. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Not Found**: Verify agent paths in configuration
2. **Plugin Loading Errors**: Check ElizaOS plugin compatibility
3. **Blockchain Connection Issues**: Verify network configuration
4. **Deployment Failures**: Check Akash Network credentials

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot integration issues:

```bash
DEBUG=questflow:* npm start
```

## Extending the Integration

### Custom Agents

Create custom agents that integrate with 371OS services by following the agent configuration format and implementing the required capabilities.

### New Connectors

Develop new connectors for additional 371OS services by following the connector template pattern.

### Advanced Workflows

Create complex workflows that leverage multiple 371OS features, such as combining business intelligence with self-aware workspace manipulation.
