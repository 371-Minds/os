# QuestFlow Documentation

## Overview

QuestFlow is an AI workflow automation platform that enables users to orchestrate multiple AI agents in collaborative workflows.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure your agents in the `agents/` directory
3. Define workflows in the `workflows/` directory
4. Run the application: `npm start`

## Folder Structure

- `agents/` - AI agent definitions and templates
- `workflows/` - Workflow definitions and execution logs
- `tasks/` - Individual task definitions
- `connectors/` - Integration connectors for external services
- `lib/` - Core library functions
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `examples/` - Example implementations
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `scripts/` - Automation scripts

## Core Concepts

### Agents
Agents are the building blocks of QuestFlow. Each agent has specific capabilities and can perform tasks based on their configuration.

### Workflows
Workflows define the sequence of steps that agents will execute to accomplish a goal. Workflows can be linear or include parallel processing.

### Connectors
Connectors enable integration with external services and APIs, allowing agents to interact with the outside world.
