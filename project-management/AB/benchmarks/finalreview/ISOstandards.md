# ISO/IEC 26514 Documentation Audit Report for 371OS

This report details the findings of an audit of the 371OS project's documentation against the ISO/IEC 26514 standard for software user documentation.

## Compliant Areas

The audited documentation demonstrates compliance with several key principles of the ISO/IEC 26514 standard:

*   **Structure and Organization:** The documents `AGENTS.md` and `community/CONTRIBUTING.md` are well-structured with clear headings, sections, and use of formatting (bolding, lists, code blocks) to improve readability. This aligns with the standard's emphasis on logical organization.
*   **Content - Task Orientation:** The `community/CONTRIBUTING.md` file is highly task-oriented, providing clear, step-by-step instructions for common contributor tasks such as setting up the development environment, submitting bug reports, and making code contributions.
*   **Identification and Labeling:** The use of clear filenames like `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` helps in identifying the purpose of the document.

## Areas for Improvement

Several areas were identified where the documentation could be improved to better align with the ISO/IEC 26514 standard.

*   **Missing Core Documentation:**
    *   **Recommendation:** The `README.md` file at the root of the project is a critical entry point for new users and contributors. It should be created and should provide a high-level overview of the project, its purpose, and pointers to other key documentation.
    *   **Recommendation:** An `index.md` file within the `docs/` directory is a standard convention for the main landing page of more extensive documentation. This should be created to serve as a central hub for all project documentation.

*   **Lack of a Centralized Documentation Hub:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Create a main documentation landing page (e.g., in `docs/index.md`) that provides a table of contents or a clear navigational structure to all other documentation files. This will help users find the information they need more easily.

*   **Inconsistent Documentation Structure:**
    *   **Recommendation:** While individual documents are well-structured, there is no consistent structure *across* documents. A documentation style guide should be created and adopted to ensure consistency in headings, formatting, and tone across all project documentation.

*   **Absence of a Documentation Management Plan:**
    *   **Recommendation:** The ISO/IEC 26514 standard emphasizes a life-cycle approach to documentation. A document should be created that outlines the process for creating, reviewing, updating, and archiving documentation to ensure it remains accurate and relevant over time.

*   **No Information on Target Audience:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Each key document should include a section defining its intended audience (e.g., end-users, developers, system administrators). This helps to ensure that the content is appropriate for the reader's technical level.
