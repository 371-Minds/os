- **Permission validation** - Capability-based access control
- **Audit trails** - Immutable blockchain logging
- **Resource limits** - Preventing resource exhaustion attacks

#### Blockchain Security
- **Smart contract audits** - Regular security reviews
- **Decentralized verification** - Multi-node consensus
- **Stake-based reputation** - Economic incentives for honest behavior
- **Cryptographic proofs** - Verifiable agent actions

### üõ°Ô∏è Development Security

#### Code Security
- **Static analysis** - Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency scanning** - Regular security updates
- **Code review** - Mandatory security review for all changes
- **Secure coding standards** - TypeScript security best practices

#### CI/CD Security
- **Signed commits** - Cryptographic verification of changes
- **Secure pipelines** - Protected deployment workflows
- **Environment isolation** - Separate dev/staging/production
- **Artifact signing** - Verifiable build outputs

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Container security** - Minimal, hardened container images
- **Network security** - Encrypted communication channels
- **Access controls** - Role-based access management
- **Monitoring** - Real-time security event detection

### üß™ Testing Security

#### Security Testing
- **Penetration testing** - Regular security assessments
- **Vulnerability scanning** - Automated security checks
- **Fuzzing** - Input validation testing
- **Load testing** - Resilience under stress

#### Agent Testing
- **Isolation testing** - Verify agent sandboxing

#### Agent Development
- **Minimal permissions** - Request only necessary capabilities
- **Secure communication** - Use encrypted channels
- **Data protection** - Handle cognitive data responsibly
- **Resource management** - Prevent denial of service
- **Audit logging** - Log security-relevant events

### For Deployments

#### Production Security
- **Environment hardening** - Secure deployment configurations
- **Secret management** - Use Secretless Broker
- **Network security** - Implement proper firewalls
- **Monitoring** - Deploy security monitoring
- **Backup security** - Encrypt and protect backups

#### Akash Network Security
