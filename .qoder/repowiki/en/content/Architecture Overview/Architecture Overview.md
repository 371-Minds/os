## Introduction

The 371OS system represents a revolutionary autonomous agent operating system that implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture mirroring traditional corporate hierarchies. This architecture enables near-complete automation of business operations through intelligent agent orchestration, adaptive LLM routing, and enterprise-grade security implementations. The system achieves 95% autonomous operations with a target of $52,450 monthly recurring revenue, demonstrating its capability to function as a fully autonomous business organization.

The 371OS architecture is built on several key principles: agent-based decomposition, stateless coordination via blockchain-inspired patterns, and microservices-like specialization through dedicated agents. The system leverages an orchestrator-worker pattern with hierarchical C-Suite oversight, where specialized agents handle specific business functions while being coordinated by an intelligent routing system. This documentation provides a comprehensive analysis of the system's architecture, components, data flows, and implementation details.

## Project Structure

The 371OS project follows a monorepo structure with clear separation of concerns across different functional areas. The core system components are organized in a hierarchical directory structure that reflects the architectural layers.

## Core Components

The 371OS system is built around several core components that work together to create an autonomous operating system. These components include the Intelligent Router Agent, the Improved Base Agent framework, C-Suite agents, and various specialized operational agents.

The Intelligent Router Agent serves as the central coordination point, receiving user commands and routing them to appropriate specialized agents based on task classification. The Improved Base Agent provides a common foundation for all agents with built-in performance monitoring, error handling, and resource management capabilities. C-Suite agents (CEO, CTO, CFO, etc.) provide strategic oversight and decision-making, while specialized agents handle specific operational tasks like code generation, deployment, and quality assurance.

These components work together to create a hierarchical agent ecosystem that mirrors traditional corporate structures while leveraging AI capabilities for autonomous operation.

**Diagram sources**
- [universal_mcp_architecture.md](file://371-os/docs/architecture/universal_mcp_architecture.md)

### Core Principles

The Universal MCP Architecture is built on three fundamental principles that ensure cross-platform compatibility, reliability, and security.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- All MCP servers must be platform-agnostic
- Windows-specific automation (like AppleScript) is prohibited
- Use cross-platform alternatives: PowerShell, URL schemes, Extension APIs
- Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux

**Stateless Design**
- MCP servers are stateless by design
- All state is managed through the blockchain registry
- Session persistence is handled by the Universal Tool Server
- No local state storage in MCP servers

**Blockchain Coordination**
- Agent discovery through decentralized registry
- Trust established through cryptographic verification
- Economic incentives through stake-based reputation system
- Decentralized coordination eliminates single points of failure

### MCP Server Structure

All MCP servers in 371OS follow a standardized structure that ensures consistency across implementations:

```
packages/elizaos-plugins/{mcp-name}/
├── src/
│   ├── plugin.ts          # Main plugin definition
│   ├── actions.ts         # Agent actions
│   ├── provider.ts        # Context provider
│   ├── evaluator.ts       # Quality assessment
│   ├── types.ts           # Type definitions
│   └── index.ts           # Exports
├── package.json           # Package configuration
├── project.json           # Nx workspace configuration
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md              # Documentation
```

This standardized structure enables consistent development practices, easier maintenance, and simplified integration with the 371OS agent framework.

### Universal MCP Router

The Universal MCP Router serves as the central component that routes requests between agents and MCP servers. It provides intelligent routing based on agent requirements, platform compatibility, and performance metrics.

Key features of the Universal MCP Router include:
- Centralized request routing for all MCP servers
- Platform compatibility checking before routing
- Performance monitoring and load balancing
- Fallback mechanisms for failed requests
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Security validation for all routed requests

The router ensures that agent requests are directed to the most appropriate MCP server based on the specific requirements of the task and the capabilities of available MCP servers.

### Existing MCP Servers

The 371OS ecosystem currently supports several MCP servers that provide cross-platform functionality:

**Wavebox MCP**
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Features: URL control, profile management, session handling

These MCP servers demonstrate the effectiveness of the Universal MCP Architecture in providing consistent, reliable tool integration across all supported platforms.

### Implementation Guidelines

When creating new MCP servers for the 371OS ecosystem, developers should follow these implementation guidelines:

**Creating New MCP Servers**
1. Follow the standard MCP server structure
2. Ensure cross-platform compatibility
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Document platform-specific considerations
5. Test on all supported platforms

**Integration with 371OS Agents**
```typescript
// Example agent configuration with MCP integration
const agentConfig = {
  name: 'TestAgent',
  plugins: [
    WaveboxMCPPlugin,    // Cross-platform Wavebox integration
    GithubMCPPlugin,     // Cross-platform GitHub integration
    CustomAgentMCPPlugin // Custom agent coordination
  ]
};
```

**Error Handling and Fallbacks**
```typescript
// Robust error handling for cross-platform compatibility
try {
  // Attempt primary automation method
  await executePrimaryMethod();
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to alternative method
  await executeFallbackMethod();
}
```

These guidelines ensure that new MCP servers integrate seamlessly with the existing 371OS architecture and maintain the high standards of cross-platform compatibility and reliability.

### Security Considerations

The Universal MCP Architecture implements a comprehensive zero-trust security model:

**Zero-Trust Architecture**
- No hardcoded credentials in MCP servers
- All authentication through Secretless Broker
- Cryptographic verification of all interactions
- Role-based access control between agents and MCP servers

**Platform-Specific Security**
- Windows: Proper PowerShell execution policy handling
- All Platforms: Secure storage of sensitive data
- Network: Encrypted communication between components
- Input validation: Sanitization of all user inputs

These security measures ensure that MCP servers operate securely within the 371OS ecosystem while maintaining the integrity of agent communications and data.
