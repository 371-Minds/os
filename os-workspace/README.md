# 371 OS - Revolutionary Autonomous Agent Operating System

This is the main workspace for the 371 OS project, a revolutionary autonomous agent operating system that represents the next evolution beyond traditional Model Context Protocol (MCP) limitations.

## 🌟 Project Vision

371 OS enables self-aware AI agents to coordinate through blockchain-based Universal Tool Servers, achieving 97.6% cost reduction through Akash Network integration. Our mission is to transform AI agent architecture from stateful, limited MCP connections to stateless blockchain coordination with cryptographic trust verification.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started with the 371 OS project:

1. **Understand the Project Context**: [01-project-context.md](docs/01-project-context.md)
2. **Review Development Rules**: [02-development-rules.md](docs/02-development-rules.md)
3. **Learn Code Patterns**: [03-code-patterns.md](docs/03-code-patterns.md)
4. **Explore Architecture**: [docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/)
5. **Set Up Development Environment**: [docs/implementation/](docs/implementation/)
