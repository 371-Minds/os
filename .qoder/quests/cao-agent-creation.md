# Chief Academic Officer (CAO) Agent Design

## Overview

The Chief Academic Officer (CAO) Agent represents a crucial addition to the 371 OS C-Suite executive layer, responsible for monitoring agent performance, managing educational components, and ensuring continuous improvement of the autonomous workforce. Following the established unified "brain/body" architecture pattern, the CAO Agent will provide comprehensive academic leadership, performance analytics, and learning optimization across the entire agent ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Brain/Body Separation Pattern

The CAO Agent follows the established unified architecture pattern with clear separation between cognitive decision-making and execution capabilities:

#### Agent "Brain" (Cognitive Layer)
- **Location**: `libs/prompts/agent-definitions/cao_agent.yml`
- **Purpose**: Defines the CAO's core personality, decision-making frameworks, and academic leadership protocols
- **Content**: Academic policies, performance evaluation criteria, educational curriculum guidelines, and learning optimization strategies

#### Agent "Body" (Execution Layer)
- **Location**: `apps/cao-agent/` (New Nx Application)
- **Purpose**: Implements the runtime execution environment with performance monitoring, educational delivery, and agent assessment capabilities
- **Architecture**: TypeScript/Node.js application with modular component structure

### Component Architecture

The CAO Agent consists of four primary operational components:
