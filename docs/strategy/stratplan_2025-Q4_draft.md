- I need to write a process for my organization, but I’m not sure how to get started.
- I have a few ideas in mind to describe a process, but I’d like to formalize it quickly.
- I’d like to use AI to organize notes I have taken about a process.
- I’d like help to enhance my process model with common elements such as risks, rules, documents or standard steps.
- I have very text-heavy documentation, and I’d like to create a summary with a flowchart.
</aside>

## How it works?

<aside>

<aside>

### 👉 **Step #1 - Create a dedicated page in Notion**

</aside>

<aside>

### 👉 **Step #2 - Connect E.V.A to Your Notion App**

</aside>

<aside>

### **⚙️ Step #3 - Select the task for E.V.A to execute**

</aside>

<aside>

### **📝 Step #4 - Describe your process to E.V.A**

</aside>

<aside>

### 🎯 **Step #5 - Select your Notion destination page and generate the process**

</aside>

<aside>

### **👀** **Step #6 - Check the results**

</aside>

</aside>

## 💡 Step-by-step instructions 💡

<aside>

### 👉 **Step #1 : Create a page in Notion**

This first step is crucial! E.V.A requires a Notion page to function, where it will display the results of the generated process.

![Group 19756.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com///Group_19756.png)

</aside>

<aside>

### 👉 **Step #2 : Connect E.V.A to Your Notion App**

Click on the "✨ Generate" button at the top of this page, then link the previously created page by selecting it from the drop-down menu that appears below.

![Capture d’écran 2025-01-22 à 15.45.38.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com///Capture_decran_2025-01-22_a_15.45.38.png)

![notion_select.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com///notion_select.png)

</aside>

<aside>

### **⚙️ Step #3 : Select the task for E.V.A to execute**

E.V.A can perform two distinct tasks:

- **Generate a process template** starting from a process name and little bit of context.
- **Streamline a process** using existing information.

![Capture d’écran 2025-01-14 à 09.41.29.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com///Capture_decran_2025-01-14_a_09.41.29.png)

</aside>

<aside>

### **📝 Step #4 : Describe your process**

- **Process template:** Start with a name and provide context like industry, company size, product/service type, and sector.
- **Process organisation:** To achieve better results, make sure to include a name and detailed steps. For each step, you may specify roles and responsibilities, tools used, inputs and outputs, potential risks, and controls implemented.

![Capture d’écran 2025-01-14 à 09.47.43.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com///Capture_decran_2025-01-14_a_09.47.43.png)

![Capture d’écran 2025-01-14 à 09.48.11.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com///Capture_decran_2025-01-14_a_09.48.11.png)

<aside>
📌

- The more precise the description, the more accurate the results will be.
</aside>

</aside>

<aside>

### 🎯 **Step #5 : Select your Notion destination page and generate**

Select the page you created in the first step, then click the ‘Generate’ button.

![Capture d’écran 2024-12-19 à 16.20.39.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com///Capture_decran_2024-12-19_a_16.20.39.png)

<aside>
📌

- If the page from Step #1 isn't in the drop-down menu, you may have forgotten to select it when connecting Notion to E.V.A. Simply use the link shown in the image above to fix it
</aside>

</aside>

<aside>

### **👀 Step #6 : Review the diagram image and add it to Notion**

Click the copy button, then paste the image directly into your Notion page in the designated placeholder.

![Capture d’écran 2025-01-15 à 10.06.49.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com///Capture_decran_2025-01-15_a_10.06.49.png)

<aside>
📌

- Alternatively, you can download the diagram and re-upload to Notion
- *Note that Notion does not currently support drag-and-drop for this feature.*
</aside>

</aside>

<aside>

### **👀 Step #7 : Enjoy the dedicated page**

Review the page for any errors or misunderstandings. Once the results are displayed, you can easily edit, adjust colors or rearrange the components as needed. The image below is for reference only.
