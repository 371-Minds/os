# CEO Agent (Mimi) - Strategic Leadership Agent

## 🎯 Overview

The CEO Agent (Mimi) is the strategic leadership component of the 371 DAO ecosystem, implementing the unified "brain/body" architecture pattern. This agent serves as the Chief Executive Officer, providing intelligent task delegation, strategic oversight, and multi-domain coordination capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Unified Brain/Body Pattern
- **Brain**: Agent definition stored in `libs/prompts/agent-definitions/mimi_ceo.yml`
- **Body**: TypeScript application implementing strategic orchestration and delegation

### Core Components
- **Strategic Orchestrator**: High-level strategic decision making and task complexity analysis
- **Task Delegator**: Enhanced routing logic with semantic analysis and context awareness
- **Health Monitor**: Comprehensive monitoring and performance tracking
- **Integration Layer**: Agent registry and external system connections

## 🚀 Features

### Strategic Capabilities
- ✅ Intelligent task delegation based on domain expertise
- ✅ Multi-domain coordination for complex initiatives  
- ✅ Strategic impact analysis and priority management
- ✅ Executive escalation for high-stakes decisions
- ✅ Performance monitoring and optimization

### Enhanced Routing
- **Semantic Analysis**: Beyond simple keyword matching
- **Context Awareness**: Considers agent workload and performance history
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient agent utilization
- **Confidence Scoring**: Data-driven delegation decisions

### Performance Targets
- Response Time: <500ms
- Delegation Accuracy: >95%
- Escalation Rate: <5%
- Agent Availability: >98%

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Task Processing

```typescript
import { CEOAgent } from './src/index.js';

const ceoAgent = new CEOAgent();

const task = {
  id: 'task_001',
  title: 'Quarterly Financial Review',
  description: 'Analyze Q3 financial performance and budget optimization',
  priority: 'high',
  domain: 'financial',
  complexity_score: 0.6,
  resource_requirements: [],
  stakeholders: ['CFO', 'Finance Team'],
  strategic_implications: true,
  created_at: new Date(),
  updated_at: new Date()
};

const result = await ceoAgent.processTask(task);
console.log('Delegation Result:', result);
```

### Health Monitoring

```typescript
const healthStatus = await ceoAgent.healthCheck();
console.log('Agent Health:', healthStatus.status);
console.log('Overall Score:', healthStatus.overall_score);
```

### Multiple Task Coordination

```typescript
const tasks = [
  // Financial task
  { id: 'fin_001', domain: 'financial', ... },
  // Technical task  
  { id: 'tech_001', domain: 'technical', ... }
];

const results = await ceoAgent.processTasks(tasks);
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Agent Definition
The agent's core configuration is defined in:
```
libs/prompts/agent-definitions/mimi_ceo.yml
```

Key configuration sections:
- **Core Instructions**: Strategic leadership responsibilities
- **Personality Traits**: Decision-making characteristics
- **Delegation Rules**: Domain-to-agent mapping with confidence thresholds
- **Escalation Criteria**: Conditions requiring human oversight
- **Performance Targets**: SLA definitions and monitoring thresholds

### Runtime Settings
```typescript
// Performance targets
response_time_ms: 500
delegation_accuracy_rate: 0.95
escalation_rate: 0.05
agent_availability_target: 0.98

// Monitoring settings
health_check_interval: 30000ms
performance_logging: true
metric_collection_interval: 60000ms
```

## 🎭 Agent Personalities & Behaviors

### Strategic Leadership Traits
