i am setting up qoder and it has a built in nx settings i'm configuring. can you provide Nx Console: Generator Allowlist
A list of generator names or wildcard patterns to show in the picker (can be combined with Generator Block List).

The name of the generator should be in this format: @package:generator.
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ examples: @nx/workspace:library, @nx/workspace:*, @nrwl*
Perfect! Here are the recommended Nx Console Generator Allowlist settings for your 371 OS workspace:

🎯 Nx Console: Generator Allowlist

🎯 Alternative: Comprehensive Pattern
If you want everything Nx-related plus your custom generators:

@nx/*
@nrwl/*
@elizaos/*
@371-minds/*
🔧 Recommended for 371 OS Development
Based on your architecture, I recommend this focused list:

@nx/workspace:library
@nx/workspace:move
@nx/workspace:remove
@nx/js:library
@nx/node:application
@nx/node:library
@nx/react:application
@nx/react:component
@nx/plugin:plugin
@elizaos/*
@371-minds/*
💡 Why These Generators?
@nx/workspace:* - Essential workspace management
@nx/js:* - TypeScript libraries for your plugins
@nx/node:* - Backend services and agents
@nx/react:* - Frontend apps (Venture Forge, etc.)
@elizaos/* - Your custom ElizaOS plugins
@371-minds/* - Your custom 371 OS generators
This will give Qoder access to all the generators you need for building self-aware agents and autonomous business systems! 🤖✨

The wildcard patterns (*) ensure you get all generators from those packages, while specific ones like @nx/workspace:library give you exactly what you need for your architecture.
