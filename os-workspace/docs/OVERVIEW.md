# 371 OS - Revolutionary Autonomous Agent Operating System

## Project Overview

371 OS is a revolutionary Autonomous Agent Operating System designed to overcome limitations of traditional Model Context Protocol (MCP) systems through blockchain-based Universal Tool Servers. It enables true agent autonomy with significant cost reductions.

## System Architecture

The system follows a decentralized architecture with:

- Agent Ecosystem (CEO, CTO, CFO, CLO agents) at the top layer
- Nx Monorepo Workspace as the development framework
- ElizaOS Plugins for agent capabilities
- Ethereum Smart Contracts for decentralized registry
- IPFS for distributed metadata storage
- Akash Network for cost-optimized deployment

## Key Features

1. **Universal Tool Server Architecture**: Stateless, blockchain-based agent coordination
2. **Self-Aware Agents**: Agents that understand and manipulate their own workspace
3. **Cost Optimization**: 97.6% cost reduction through Akash Network deployment
4. **Decentralized Registry**: Blockchain-based agent discovery with cryptographic trust
5. **Enterprise Security**: Zero-trust architecture with Secretless Broker and ACI.dev
6. **Economic Incentives**: Stake-based reputation system for agent reliability
