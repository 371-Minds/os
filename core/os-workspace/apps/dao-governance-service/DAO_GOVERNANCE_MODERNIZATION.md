## üîß Agent Resolver Service

### Purpose
Maps between legacy agent identifiers and modern ElizaOS character definitions, providing unified agent identification and capability resolution.

### Key Features
- **Legacy ID Mapping**: Supports all historical agent identifier formats
- **Character Resolution**: Integrates with `@elizaos/characters` package
- **Voting Weight Calculation**: Character-specific voting power and staking weights
- **Capability Queries**: Find agents with specific capabilities
- **Execution Agent Resolution**: Identify responsible agents for proposal phases

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Resolve legacy agent ID to modern character
const resolved = agentResolver.resolveAgent('ceo_mimi');
// Returns: { agentId: 'ceo-mimi-character', characterRole: 'CEO', ... }

// Get voting weight for agent
const weight = agentResolver.getAgentVotingWeight('cfo');
// Returns: { votingPower: 900, stakingWeight: 0.35, ... }

// Find agents with specific capability
const strategists = agentResolver.getAgentsWithCapability('strategic_planning');
// Returns: [CEO, CTO, CFO characters with strategic planning capability]
```

## üß† Enhanced Cognitive Integration

### Automatic Analysis Triggers
- **Proposal Submission**: Cognitive analysis automatically triggered when proposals are submitted
- **Human Approval**: Additional cognitive insights generated for approval decisions
- **Persistent Storage**: Cognitive summaries stored with proposals for future reference

### Cognitive Analysis Workflow
1. **Analysis Request**: Structured query sent to Cognition Layer MCP
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Assessment against Chief AI Orchestrator's workstreams
3. **Risk Analysis**: Identification of potential risks and mitigation strategies
4. **Alignment Scoring**: Numerical alignment score (0.0 to 1.0) for decision support
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Actionable insights and recommendations

### Enhanced Decision Making
```typescript
// Cognitive summary attached to proposals
interface CognitiveSummary {
  keyInsights: string[];           // Strategic insights from analysis
  riskAnalysis: string[];          // Identified risks and concerns
  relevantWorkstreams: string[];   // Related organizational priorities
  alignmentScore: number;          // 0.0 to 1.0 alignment rating
  confidence: number;              // Analysis confidence level
  recommendations: string[];       // Actionable recommendations
  potentialBlockers: string[];     // Identified potential obstacles
}
```

## üîó GraphBit Workflow Integration

### Event-Driven Architecture
The service now emits structured events that GraphBit workflows can listen for and respond to automatically.

### Key Integration Points

#### 1. Human Approval Events
```typescript
// Emitted when human approves a proposal
{
  event_type: 'PROPOSAL_HUMAN_APPROVED',
  proposal_id: 'PROP-12345',
  workflow_data: {
    execution_details: { /* proposal execution phases */ },
    budget_request: { /* financial requirements */ },
    impacted_agents: ['ceo-mimi-character', 'cto-zara-character'],
    cognitive_summary: { /* AI analysis results */ }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Workflow Integration Endpoints
- **GET** `/workflows/ready-for-execution` - Get proposals ready for workflow execution
- **POST** `/workflows/:proposal_id/execution-started` - Mark proposal execution as started

#### 3. Execution Coordination
```typescript
// GraphBit can query for workflow-ready proposals
const workflowReady = await fetch('/api/governance/workflows/ready-for-execution');

// Mark execution as started
await fetch(`/api/governance/workflows/${proposalId}/execution-started`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    workflow_id: 'WF-789',
    started_by: 'graphbit-orchestrator'
  })
});
```

## üìä Voting System Enhancements

### Character-Based Voting Power
Voting power is now calculated using the Agent Resolver Service, which provides consistent, character-specific voting weights:

- **CEO (Mimi)**: 1000 voting power, 40% governance weight
- **CTO (Zara)**: 800 voting power, 30% governance weight  
- **CFO (Maya)**: 900 voting power, 35% governance weight
- **CLO (Alex)**: 700 voting power, 25% governance weight

### Agent Participation Tracking
```typescript
// Enhanced participation metrics with character resolution
interface AgentParticipation {
  agent_type: CharacterRole;        // CEO, CTO, CFO, CLO
  agent_id: string;                 // Modern character identifier
  total_eligible: number;           // Number of eligible agents of this type
  votes_cast: number;               // Actual votes cast
  participation_rate: number;       // Percentage participation
  voting_power_exercised: number;   // Total voting power used
}
```

## üîÑ Human Approval Workflow

### Enhanced Approval Process
1. **Agent Voting**: C-Suite agents vote on proposals using character-based identities
2. **Cognitive Analysis**: AI analysis provides strategic insights and risk assessment
3. **Human Review**: Human operators review proposals with cognitive summaries
4. **Approval Decision**: Human approval/rejection with reasoning and conditions
5. **Workflow Trigger**: GraphBit workflow automatically initiated upon approval

### Cognitive-Enhanced Decisions
```typescript
// Human approval enriched with cognitive insights
const approvalRequest: HumanApprovalRequest = {
  proposal_id: 'PROP-12345',
  decision: HumanApprovalStatus.APPROVED,
  approved_by: 'human-operator-001',
  reasoning: 'High cognitive alignment score (0.95) and clear strategic value',
  conditions: ['Monitor performance metrics', 'Weekly progress reports'],
  escalation_level: 'standard'
};
```
