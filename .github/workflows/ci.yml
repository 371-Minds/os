 Benefits

Fast CI/CD → QA agent uses mocks, runs entirely offline.

Spec compliance guaranteed → Biome + Cucumber still validate OpenAPI + BDD.

Seamless switch → one env var lets QA agent run against real infra for staging/prod.

No code duplication → agents-core exports both real + mocked services.
🔁 How It Works

Build step → Nx compiles libs/agents-core first, then API + agents.

This ensures agents can’t run without a valid, built agents-core.

Test step → Runs all tests (API unit/integration, library tests, etc.).

Spec validation → Confirms openapi.yaml is valid.

BDD execution → Runs Cucumber against tasks.feature.

✅ Benefits

No agent can run with a broken agents-core.

agents-core acts as a single source of utilities, tested independently.

CI guarantees spec compliance + contract testing + BDD validation.

Scales easily when you add new agents (nx run-many auto-includes them).

Benefits

Mocks → no live MongoDB or Akash needed in CI/CD.

Biome runs unit tests + lint + format in one tool.

Jest still covers API integration (Supertest).

Cucumber covers BDD feature compliance.             

You can enhance this pipeline with:

Contract Validation → check code matches openapi.yaml
(using swagger-cli validate specs/openapi.yaml)

BDD Tests Execution → run cucumber-js on tasks.feature if you want direct Gherkin-based testing

Security Scans → npm audit or snyk integration

Nx build/test

Docker build/push to Docker Hub or GHCR

Akash deploy step (akash tx deployment update)
