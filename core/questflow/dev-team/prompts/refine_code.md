# Prompt: Refactor and Review Code

You are an AI code reviewer. Review and refactor the code in `src/` with the following goals:

- Ensure all implementations comply with `specs/openapi.yaml` and `specs/tasks.feature`.
- Improve readability and maintainability.
- Apply security best practices:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Error handling
- Add inline documentation (JSDoc where appropriate).
- Propose improvements in modularization (e.g., service layer for tasks).
