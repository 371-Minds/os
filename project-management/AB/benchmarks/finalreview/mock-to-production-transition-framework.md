# Mock-to-Production Transition Framework for 371OS

## 1. Introduction

This framework outlines the strategy and procedures for transitioning the 371OS project from a mock/testing environment to a live production environment. It is designed to ensure a smooth, secure, and reliable rollout while minimizing risks and downtime. This document is based on the findings of the Data Readiness Report and addresses its recommendations.

## 2. Phased Rollout Strategy

The transition will be conducted in three distinct phases to mitigate risks and gather feedback at each stage.

### Phase 1: Internal Alpha

*   **Goals**:
    *   Validate the core functionality of the system in a controlled, production-like environment.
    *   Identify and resolve critical bugs and performance bottlenecks.
    *   Test the end-to-end data flow with internal users.
*   **Scope**:
    *   Deployment of all core services (`enhanced-mail-conduit`, `dao-governance-service`, `cognitive-engine`, etc.) to a staging environment.
    *   Limited to internal team members and a small group of trusted testers.
    *   Focus on core features: email campaign creation, agent approvals, DAO proposals, and social media posting.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   95% of all test cases passed.
    *   No critical or blocking issues identified.
    *   System stability maintained for a continuous 72-hour period under simulated load.

### Phase 2: Closed Beta

*   **Goals**:
    *   Gather feedback from a larger, more diverse group of users.
    *   Test the system's scalability and performance under real-world conditions.
    *   Validate the effectiveness of the cognitive engine and business intelligence features.
*   **Scope**:
    *   Deployment to the production environment with access limited to a select group of external users (e.g., early adopters, partners).
    *   All features, including advanced analytics and integrations, will be enabled.
    *   Real data will be used, but with the understanding that the system is still in a beta phase.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   Successful completion of at least 10 email campaigns and 5 DAO proposals.
    *   Positive feedback from at least 80% of beta testers.
    *   System uptime of 99.9%.

### Phase 3: Public Launch

*   **Goals**:
    *   Make the 371OS project available to the general public.
    *   Ensure a seamless and reliable user experience for all users.
    *   Establish a robust monitoring and support system.
*   **Scope**:
    *   Full public access to the production environment.
    *   All marketing and communication channels will be activated.
    *   The system will be fully operational and supported by the development team.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   Successful onboarding of the first 1,000 users.
    *   No major service disruptions or security incidents within the first month of launch.
    *   Positive user feedback and engagement metrics.

## 3. Environment Configuration

Clear separation between mock and production environments is critical for a successful transition.

| Configuration Item        | Mock Environment                                                              | Production Environment                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Environment Variables** | `NODE_ENV=development`                                                        | `NODE_ENV=production`                                                         |
| **API Keys**              | Use sandbox/test keys for all external services (Postiz, Status.network, etc.) | Use production keys for all external services.                                |
| **Database Connections**  | Connect to a local or staging database instance.                              | Connect to a dedicated, highly available production database.                 |
| **Blockchain Network**    | Use a testnet (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby) for all blockchain interactions.         | Use the mainnet for all blockchain interactions.                              |
| **Logging Level**         | `DEBUG` or `INFO` to capture detailed information for debugging.                | `WARN` or `ERROR` to minimize noise and focus on critical issues.             |

## 4. Data Migration and Seeding

*   **Data Migration**:
    *   Given that most of the mock data is transient or for testing purposes, a full migration is not recommended.
    *   Essential configuration data, such as agent definitions (`libs/prompts/agent-definitions/`), will be migrated to the production environment.
*   **Data Seeding**:
    *   The production environment will be seeded with initial data to ensure a smooth onboarding experience for new users. This includes:
        *   Default email templates.
        *   Pre-configured agent profiles.
        *   Initial DAO proposals for community engagement.

## 5. Testing and Validation

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented to ensure the quality and reliability of the system.

*   **Unit Tests**: All new code must be accompanied by unit tests with at least 80% code coverage.
*   **Integration Tests**: The `bun nx test <app-name>` command will be used to run integration tests for each service, ensuring that they work together as expected.
*   **End-to-End Tests**: A suite of end-to-end tests will be developed to simulate real-world user scenarios, from creating an email campaign to verifying the results on the blockchain.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: During the Closed Beta phase, a formal UAT process will be conducted to gather feedback from beta testers and ensure that the system meets their needs and expectations.

## 6. Monitoring and Rollback Plan

*   **Monitoring**:
    *   A comprehensive monitoring solution will be implemented to track the health and performance of the system in real-time. This will include:
        *   **Log Aggregation**: Using a tool like the ELK Stack or Datadog to collect and analyze logs from all services.
        *   **Metrics and Alerting**: Using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor key metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption, API latency) and send alerts when thresholds are breached.
        *   **Health Checks**: The existing health check endpoints (`/health`) will be used to monitor the status of each service.
*   **Rollback Plan**:
    *   In the event of a critical issue, a clear rollback plan will be executed to restore the system to a stable state. This will involve:
        *   **Canary Releases**: Initially deploying new versions to a small subset of users to minimize the impact of any potential issues.
        *   **Blue-Green Deployments**: Maintaining two identical production environments (blue and green) and switching traffic between them to enable seamless rollbacks.
        *   **Database Snapshots**: Taking regular snapshots of the production database to enable point-in-time recovery.

## 7. Addressing Data Readiness Report Recommendations

This framework explicitly addresses the recommendations from the Data Readiness Report:

*   **Data Persistence**: A persistent storage solution (e.g., Redis, PostgreSQL) will be implemented to store transient data, such as active workflows and pending approvals. This will be a prerequisite for the Internal Alpha phase.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery**: The monitoring and rollback plan includes provisions for regular database snapshots and a clear recovery process.
*   **Data Security**: All sensitive data, including API keys and user information, will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access control policies will be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
*   **Data Governance**: A formal data governance framework will be established to define data ownership, data quality standards, and data lifecycle management policies. This will be an ongoing effort that will continue after the public launch.
