üìå Key Notes

Audience Targeting: Apply this campaign only to users who visited Step 1 (The Veil) but did not trigger your email autoresponder.

Messaging Style: Cryptic and whisper-like, never salesy. Keeps the mystique alive.

Ad Rotation: Rotate evenly so prospects see different reminders (‚Äúunfinished threads‚Äù, ‚Äúmissing frequency‚Äù, etc.).

‚ö° Pro Tip: Pair these with Microsoft Audience Ads (native placements on MSN + Outlook + LinkedIn sites). The dark visuals + whisper text will feel hauntingly consistent.
