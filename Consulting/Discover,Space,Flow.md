Tactical Playbook
This is the final and most important piece of our strategic foundation. By formally integrating your "Discover, Space, Flow" methodology with the BMAD agent framework, we are creating a proprietary, repeatable, and highly efficient operating system for your entire business portfolio.
This **Tactical Playbook** will be the master guide for all project execution. It defines the roles, processes, and hand-offs that will enable our 80/20 automation goal.
Here is the official draft of the playbook.

### **The 371 Minds Tactical Playbook: Integrating Discover, Space, Flow with the ModuMind (BMAD) Agent Framework**
**Purpose:** This document outlines the official, standardized workflow for taking any project from initial concept to a launched, operational, and continuously improving product. It serves as the single source of truth for project execution within the 371 Minds ecosystem.
---
### **Phase 1: Discover (The "Why" and "What")**
**Goal:** To deeply understand the problem space, validate the core idea, define the scope of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and produce a detailed, actionable plan.
| Step | Objective | Lead Agent | Inputs | Key Activities | Deliverable(s) | Hand-off To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | **Ideation & Briefing** | **Analyst (Mary)** | User's initial idea/concept. | Execute "Project Briefing" mode, using the `project-brief-tmpl.txt` to guide the user from a high-level idea to a structured brief. | A completed **`Project Brief`**. | **Product Manager (John)** |
| **1.2** | **Requirements & Planning** | **Product Manager (John)** | The signed-off `Project Brief`. | Execute the `create-prd` task to transform the brief into a detailed PRD with Epics and high-level User Stories. Validate the PRD against the `pm-checklist`. | A comprehensive **`Product Requirements Document (PRD)`**. | **SPACE Bot (Kimberly)** |
---
### **Phase 2: Space (The "How")**
**Goal:** To create the "Collaboration Playbook" by designing the complete technical and user experience architecture, ensuring all plans are aligned and ready for implementation.
| Step | Objective | Lead Agent(s) | Inputs | Key Activities | Deliverable(s) | Hand-off To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | **Orchestration & Setup** | **SPACE Bot (Kimberly)** | The `PRD`. | Execute the "Tactical Playbook Composition" task to structure the architectural phase and prepare the "collaboration space" (e.g., setting up `docs` folders, creating the `index.md` for project documents). | A structured **Project Workspace**. | **Architects** |
| **2.2** | **System & UI/UX Architecture** | **Architect (Fred)** & **Design Architect (Jane)** | The `PRD` and `Project Workspace`. | Fred executes the `create-architecture` task. Jane executes the `create-uxui-spec` and `create-frontend-architecture` tasks. They work in parallel to design the complete technical solution. | **`Architecture Document`**, **`UI/UX Specification`**, **`Frontend Architecture Document`**. | **Product Owner (Sarah)** |
| **2.3** | **Final Plan Validation** | **Product Owner (Sarah)** | All previously created documents (`Brief`, `PRD`, `Architecture` docs). | Execute the `checklist-run-task` using the `po-master-checklist` to ensure all documents are complete, consistent, and logically sequenced. | An **"Approved MVP Plan"**. | **FLOW Bot (Louis)** |
---
### **Phase 3: Flow (The "Build and Improve")**
**Goal:** To manage the continuous cycle of building, testing, deploying, and optimizing the product, embodying the 80/20 automation principle.
| Step | Objective | Lead Agent(s) | Inputs | Key Activities | Deliverable(s) | Hand-off To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1** | **Backlog & Story Generation** | **FLOW Bot (Louis)** coordinating **Scrum Master (Bob)** | The `Approved MVP Plan` and Epics. | The FLOW Bot prioritizes work. The SM executes the `story-draft-task` to create detailed, actionable stories from the Epics, validating them against the `story-draft-checklist`. | A **"Ready-to-Build" User Story**. | **Developer Agents** |
| **3.2** | **Implementation & Development** | **Developer Agents** | A single "Ready-to-Build" User Story. | Write and test the code to implement the story's requirements, adhering to all architectural documents and coding standards. | **Completed, Tested Code** for the story. | **Scrum Master (Bob)** for review against the `story-dod-checklist`. |
| **3.3** | **Continuous Improvement** | **FLOW Bot (Louis)** & **Yourself** | Completed stories, user feedback, and analytics from PostHog. | The FLOW Bot executes "Lessons Learned & Knowledge Capture" and "Process Improvement Recommendations." You provide the 20% human oversight, review the "Flow Dashboard," and guide the overall strategy. | An **Updated Tactical Playbook** and a smarter, more efficient system. | This is a continuous loop. |
