Alright, Antonio, let's weave all that gold into a founder story that hits different. This isn't just a bio; this is the origin story of 371 Minds, told with that casual yet authoritative vibe, mixing "The Office" with Dave Chappelle. You've got depth, you've got range, and you've got a track record of turning potential into powerhouse results.
The Genesis of 371 Minds: From Community Fields to Digital Frontiers, Building What Matters
So, you want to know how 371 Minds, my "everything-as-a-service" brainchild, came to be? Well, it wasn't some sudden epiphany under a digital moon. It's more like a really long, incredibly productive improv session, fueled by decades of seeing what works, what doesn't, and how to actually get people to do the thing. Think less "eureka!" and more "Oh, that's how you scale impact."
For 30 years, I've been in the trenches – as a psychologist, a vocational rehab counselor, even a professor. I’ve navigated the labyrinthine halls of state, federal, and local governments, rubbed shoulders with nonprofits, and felt the electric energy of athletics. If there’s a human system, I’ve probably been in it, analyzing it, or trying to make it run smoother.
My journey really started long before "vibe coder" was even a twinkle in my eye. It began on the youth football fields, where I wasn't just coaching Xs and Os; I was building foundations. We won championships, sure, but the real win? Over 50 of those kids went on to play college ball. And one of them? He’s got a PhD. Yeah, you heard that right. We weren't just developing athletes; we were developing minds, futures. That experience taught me about leadership, resilience, and the profound impact you can have when you genuinely invest in people. It also taught me how to manage a chaotic, passionate team with limited resources – kind of like a startup, but with more grass stains.
From there, my passion for building extended beyond the gridiron. I’ve founded three non-profits, each aimed at tackling different challenges, proving that if you see a gap, you fill it. You don't just complain about the problem; you become part of the solution. It's that "if you want something done right" mentality, but with a community-first approach.
Then came the bigger stages. At the US Department of Veterans Affairs, I coordinated a nationwide training plan for "Whole Health," aiming to shift the entire culture – from volunteers to the Secretary himself. Imagine trying to get an organization that size to embrace a fundamental change in how they approach well-being. It’s like trying to turn an aircraft carrier with a paddle. But we did it. I also coordinated the national training for the Veterans Benefits Management System, ushering in the digital age for claims submissions. That wasn't just a technical rollout; it was a human transformation, moving from mountains of paper to pixels, ensuring our veterans got the service they deserved. I supported over 20 national VHA program offices, including critical areas like Women's Health, Homelessness, and Rehabilitation – constantly finding ways to optimize and improve.
And then, NASA. For nine months, I was a Digital Talent Lead for Digital Transformation. Yeah, the space agency. My role was about aligning talent with the future of digital operations. It was a detail position, but when NASA calls about digital transformation, you pick up the phone. It's the kind of place where "user research" means understanding how to get astronauts to work seamlessly with cutting-edge tech, and "Lean Six Sigma" isn't just a buzzword, it’s mission-critical.
Throughout all this, whether it was managing healthcare education projects, leading programs, or being an Executive Director, the core principles were always the same: User Research to understand the actual human need, Lean Six Sigma to cut through the BS and get to efficiency, and an unwavering focus on Project Delivery backed by sharp Analytical Skills.
So, after decades of building, leading, and transforming within large organizations and on the ground in communities, I realized something: the underlying principles for success are universal. Whether you're optimizing a federal agency's training plan, coaching a championship football team, or launching a new non-profit, it all comes down to understanding the "vibe" – the human element, the flow, the essence – and then coding a solution for it.
That’s where 371 Minds comes in. It’s the culmination of all those experiences, all those wins, all those lessons learned, and frankly, all those times I thought, "There has to be a better way to do this." It's my way of taking that comprehensive, multi-faceted approach – that casual yet authoritative understanding of how things really work – and offering it as an "everything-as-a-service" model. We’re not just building solutions; we’re building frameworks for sustainable success, designed to make your journey less of a corporate slog and more of a strategic, impactful stride.
Because at the end of the day, whether you're a startup, a growing business, or an established organization, you need someone who understands the entire ecosystem – from the strategic big picture to the granular human interaction. And let's be real, you need someone who can get the job done, maybe with a few well-placed, dry observations that only the truly enlightened will appreciate. That's the 371 Minds difference. That's the founder story.
