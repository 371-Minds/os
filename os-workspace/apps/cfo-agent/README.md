# CFO Agent (Maya) - Financial Leadership and Analysis

Maya is the Chief Financial Officer agent for the 371 DAO, providing comprehensive financial leadership, budget analysis, cost optimization, ROI assessment, and strategic financial decision-making capabilities.

## Overview

Maya follows the unified "brain/body" architecture pattern established in the 371 OS ecosystem, with her personality and capabilities defined in a centralized YAML configuration and her execution runtime implemented in TypeScript. This separation enables flexible agent behavior modification while maintaining robust execution capabilities.

## Architecture

### Agent Body
- **Location**: `apps/cfo-agent/src/`
- **Purpose**: TypeScript execution runtime providing financial analysis capabilities
- **Core Components**:
  - `CFOAgent` - Main agent class with task processing and coordination
  - `FinancialTaskProcessor` - Intelligent task categorization and analysis

    participant Client as Task Requester
    participant CFO as CFO Agent
    participant Processor as Task Processor
    participant Analyzer as Financial Analyzer
    participant Engine as Budget Engine
    
    Client->>CFO: Submit Financial Task
    CFO->>Processor: Analyze Task Category
    Processor->>Processor: Extract Keywords & Assess Complexity
    Processor->>CFO: Return Task Analysis
    
    alt Budget Analysis
        CFO->>Engine: Process Budget Task
        Engine->>Engine: Analyze Performance & Variance
        Engine->>CFO: Return Budget Analysis
    else Other Financial Analysis
        CFO->>Analyzer: Process Financial Task
        Analyzer->>Analyzer: Perform Domain-Specific Analysis
        Analyzer->>CFO: Return Financial Results
    end
    
    CFO->>Client: Return Financial Analysis
```

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: <1000ms for standard analysis
- **Decision Confidence**: >85% for recommendations
- **Budget Variance Detection**: 95% accuracy
- **Forecast Accuracy**: >90% for revenue projections

## Usage Examples

### Budget Analysis
```typescript
const cfoAgent = new CFOAgent();

const budgetTask = {
  id: 'budget-q4-2024',
  title: 'Q4 Budget Performance Analysis',
  description: 'Budget: $250,000, Actual: $235,000, Period: Q4-2024',
  category: 'budget_analysis',
  priority: 'high',
  requestedBy: 'finance-team',
  createdAt: new Date()
};

const result = await cfoAgent.processTask(budgetTask);
console.log('Variance:', result.result.budgetPerformance.variancePercentage);
console.log('Recommendations:', result.result.recommendations.length);
```

### Cost Optimization
```typescript
const costTask = {
  id: 'cost-opt-2024',
  title: 'Annual Cost Optimization Review',
  description: 'Analyze $500,000 operational budget for savings opportunities',
  category: 'cost_optimization',
  priority: 'medium',
  requestedBy: 'operations',
  createdAt: new Date()
};

const result = await cfoAgent.optimizeCosts(costTask.description);
console.log('Savings Potential:', result.expectedSavings.total);
console.log('Opportunities:', result.optimizationOpportunities.length);
```

### ROI Assessment
```typescript
const investmentTask = {
  id: 'roi-tech-2024',
  title: 'Technology Investment ROI',
  description: 'Evaluate $150,000 technology infrastructure investment',
  category: 'roi_assessment',
  priority: 'high',
  requestedBy: 'cto',
  createdAt: new Date()
};

const result = await cfoAgent.assessROI(investmentTask.description);
console.log('ROI:', result.financialMetrics.roi);
console.log('Recommendation:', result.recommendation.decision);
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite to validate functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run specific test categories
bun test --grep "Budget Analysis"
bun test --grep "Cost Optimization"
bun test --grep "ROI Assessment"

# Run with coverage
bun test --coverage
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Agent initialization and configuration loading
- ✅ Financial task processing across all categories
- ✅ Component validation and health checks
- ✅ Performance targets and error handling
- ✅ Integration workflows and escalation logic

## Integration

### Router Integration
Maya integrates seamlessly with the Intelligent Router for task distribution:

```typescript
// Router capability registration
const capabilities = cfoAgent.getCapabilities();
router.registerAgent('maya-cfo', capabilities);

// Task routing
const result = await router.routeTask(financialTask);
```

### Health Monitoring
```typescript
const healthCheck = await cfoAgent.healthCheck();
console.log('Status:', healthCheck.status);
console.log('Components:', healthCheck.checks.map(c => c.component));
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `CFO_AGENT_LOG_LEVEL` - Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)
- `CFO_AGENT_CACHE_TTL` - Analysis cache time-to-live in seconds
- `CFO_AGENT_MAX_CONCURRENT` - Maximum concurrent task processing

### Performance Tuning
- Adjust variance thresholds in `BudgetAnalysisEngine`
- Modify confidence scoring in `FinancialTaskProcessor`
- Configure benchmark data in `FinancialAnalyzer`
