# Automation Hooks, Extensibility Points, and Integration Capabilities in 371 OS

## Overview of Documentation Insights

The 371 OS documentation reveals a highly modular and extensible system designed for autonomous agent orchestration. Key documents including `AGENTS.md`, `CORE_LIBRARIES.md`, `CORE_TYPES.md`, `mcp_integration.md`, `USE_CASES.md`, `QUICK_START.md`, `agents.config.json`, and plugin documentation provide comprehensive insights into the system's extensibility architecture. The system emphasizes MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, plugin-based modularity, and a brain/body agent architecture that enables seamless extension of capabilities.

## 1. Plugin Architecture

**ElizaOS Plugin Ecosystem** (`core/os-workspace/packages/elizaos-plugins/`):
The 371 OS implements a sophisticated plugin architecture through the ElizaOS ecosystem, enabling modular extension of system capabilities. The plugin system is structured in `packages/elizaos-plugins/elizaos-plugins/` with specialized plugins for different domains.

**Key Plugins Identified**:
- **postiz-social** (`elizaos-plugins/postiz-social`): Revolutionary social media management with multi-platform publishing, AI-powered content generation, and spatial analytics integration
- **status-network-integration** (`elizaos-plugins/status-network-integration`): Blockchain community platform with gasless transactions and DAO governance
- **business-intelligence**: Analytics and BI tools for email and performance tracking
- **nx-workspace**: Self-aware workspace manipulation capabilities

**Plugin Usage Pattern** (from `docs/USE_CASES.md`):
```typescript
// Example: Postiz Plugin Initialization
import { PostizPlugin, SocialPlatform } from '@elizaos/plugin-postiz-social';

const plugin = new PostizPlugin({
  apiEndpoint: process.env.POSTIZ_API_ENDPOINT,
  apiKey: process.env.POSTIZ_API_KEY,
  enableSpatialInterface: true,
  enableCognitiveEngine: true,
});

const agent = plugin.createAgent('cmo-agent', {
  role: 'CMO',
  useAI: true,
  autoPublish: false,
});
```

**Dependencies and Integration**:
- Plugins leverage core libraries like `@371minds/core-types` for type safety
- Integration with cognitive engine for AI-powered operations
- MCP protocol support for external tool coordination

## 2. Agent Development and Customization

**Brain/Body Architecture** (from `AGENTS.md` and `agents.config.json`):
The system implements a unified brain/body architecture where:
- **Brain**: YAML configuration files in `libs/prompts/agent-definitions/` defining agent personality, capabilities, and behavior
- **Body**: TypeScript/Node.js runtime implementations in `apps/` directories

**Agent Registration Structure** (from `agents.config.json`, lines 48-95):
```json
"c_suite": {
  "ceo": {
    "name": "Mimi",
    "app": "ceo-agent",
    "role": "Strategic decisions, cost optimization",
    "capabilities": ["strategic_planning", "cost_optimization", "high_level_coordination"],
    "start_command": "bun nx serve ceo-agent",
    "brain_file": "libs/prompts/agent-definitions/mimi_ceo.yml",
    "mcp_integration": true
  }
}
```

**Process for Adding New Agents** (from `AGENTS.md`, lines 170-180):
1. Create agent definition YAML in `libs/prompts/agent-definitions/`
2. Generate application: `bun nx generate @nx/node:application <agent-name>`
3. Implement agent logic using ElizaOS patterns
4. Add Nx project configuration (`project.json`)
5. Implement comprehensive tests using Bun test runner

**Capabilities Definition** (from `agents.config.json`, lines 53-58):
Agents are configured with specific capabilities that determine their automation hooks and integration points, such as email coordination, cost analysis, and MCP server access.

## 3. API Endpoints for Integration

**MCP Server Endpoints** (from `mcp_integration.md` and `agents.config.json`):
The system provides multiple MCP servers with different access levels and capabilities.

**Key MCP Servers** (from `agents.config.json`, lines 136-156):
- **cognition_mcp** (`mcp://cognition-layer`): High-level cognitive state access with capabilities for cognitive detection, adaptive interfaces, and mode coordination
- **chief_of_staff_mcp** (`mcp://chief-of-staff`): Coordination hub for task management, inter-agent communication, and workflow orchestration
- **documentation_mcp** (`mcp://documentation`): Knowledge management and document retrieval

**Analytics and Monitoring Endpoints** (from `AGENTS.md`, lines 408-430):
```bash
# Email campaign performance
GET /api/analytics/dashboard?timeRange=7d

# Agent performance metrics  
GET /api/agent/coordination/status

# Blockchain verification analytics
GET /api/verification/analytics?timeRange=30d

# Cognitive optimization insights
GET /api/cognitive/analytics?timeRange=30d

# Cost optimization tracking
GET /api/cost/optimization?timeRange=30d
```

**Social Media Analytics Endpoints** (from `AGENTS.md`, lines 478-490):
```bash
# Spatial analytics for CEO's Orrery
GET /api/social/spatial-analytics?startDate=2025-01-01&endDate=2025-01-31

# Platform performance metrics
GET /api/social/platform/:platform/metrics

# Community metrics
GET /api/community/:communityId/metrics```

**MCP Tool Definitions** (from `mcp_integration.md`, lines 68-103):
The Chief of Staff MCP server exposes tools like `coordinate_agents`, `access_cognition`, and `manage_workflow` for external integration.

## 4. Configuration Files for Extensibility

**Primary Configuration Files**:

**agents.config.json** (root level):
Comprehensive configuration file defining:
- Agent registry with capabilities and MCP integration flags (lines 48-135)
- MCP server configurations with endpoints and access controls (lines 136-179)
- Use case mappings linking agents to workflows (lines 180-211)
- Deployment modes including standalone configurations (lines 212-241)
- Workspace structure definitions (lines 242-271)

**Environment Variables** (from `AGENTS.md`, various sections):
- Postiz API configuration: `POSTIZ_API_ENDPOINT`, `POSTIZ_API_KEY`
- Status Network: `STATUS_NETWORK_RPC`, `SNT_TOKEN_ADDRESS`, `DAO_FACTORY_ADDRESS`
- Email services: `PROXIEDMAIL_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_DAO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

**Brain Configuration Files** (YAML in `libs/prompts/agent-definitions/`):
Each agent has a YAML file defining its personality, behavior patterns, and integration capabilities. These files serve as the "brain" in the brain/body architecture.

## 5. Adding New Agents or Capabilities

**Agent Addition Process** (from `AGENTS.md` and `agents.config.json`):
1. **YAML Brain Creation**: Define agent personality and capabilities in `libs/prompts/agent-definitions/`
2. **Application Generation**: Use NX CLI to scaffold the TypeScript runtime: `bun nx generate @nx/node:application <agent-name>`
3. **Logic Implementation**: Implement ElizaOS patterns for agent behavior
4. **Configuration Registration**: Add to `agents.config.json` with capabilities and MCP integration
5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive tests with Bun test runner

**Capability Extension Points**:
- **Plugin System**: Add new plugins to `packages/elizaos-plugins/` for domain-specific capabilities
- **MCP Integration**: Register new MCP servers in `agents.config.json` for external tool coordination
- **API Endpoints**: Extend the analytics and monitoring API surface
- **Type Definitions**: Extend core types in `libs/core-types/` for new capabilities

**External Integration Hooks** (from `mcp_integration.md`):
The system supports integration with external AI tools through the Chief of Staff coordination hub:
- Genspark (research and knowledge discovery)
- Perplexity (deep research and fact-checking)  
- Comet Browser (web automation and data collection)
- Abacus.ai (ML platform and predictive analytics)

**Core Libraries for Extension** (from `docs/CORE_LIBRARIES.md`):
- **blockchain-registry**: Decentralized agent coordination (`libs/blockchain-registry/`)
- **ipfs-storage**: Decentralized file storage (`libs/ipfs-storage/`)
- **core-types**: Shared TypeScript interfaces (`libs/core-types/`)

**Critical Dependencies**:
- **ElizaOS Framework**: Core agent runtime and plugin ecosystem
- **Bun Runtime**: 50x faster package management and execution
- **Nx Workspace**: Monorepo management and build optimization  
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development across all components
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized interface for external tool integration

This architecture enables the 371 OS to be highly extensible while maintaining type safety, performance optimization, and seamless integration with external AI tools and services.
