ðŸ“Œ Targeting Notes

LinkedIn Integration (only available in Microsoft Ads):

Job Function: Engineering, IT, Software Development

Industry: Technology, Computer Software, Information Technology

Skills: Coding, Systems Thinking, Critical Thinking, Philosophy

Gender Filter: Female (for women in tech emphasis)

Seniority: Mid to Manager+ (filters out interns/students unless you want broader)

Creative Approach: Still whisper-style, cryptic, minimalist. The goal is intrigue, not explanation.

Audience Size: Microsoft Ads will estimate this â€” start broad (engineering + IT), then narrow if CTR is low.

âš¡ Pro Tip: Combine this LinkedIn-targeted campaign with the retargeting CSV so visitors who donâ€™t finish The Cipher see your reminder ads across MSN, Outlook, and LinkedIn. This creates a full closed-loop funnel.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also map out the full funnel visuals (ad creative â†’ landing page mockup â†’ retargeting sequence flowchart) so your design team has a plug-and-play blueprint?
