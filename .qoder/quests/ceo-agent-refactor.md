# CEO Agent (Mimi) Refactor to Unified Architecture

## Overview

This design document outlines the strategic refactoring of the CEO Agent (Mimi) from its current legacy Python implementation to the new unified "brain/body" architecture pattern established by the Chief of Staff Agent (Ortega). The refactor aims to modernize Mimi's architecture while preserving its core strategic delegation capabilities and enhancing its integration within the 371-OS agent ecosystem.

The refactoring transforms Mimi from a standalone Python agent into a TypeScript-based Nx application that follows the established architectural patterns, enabling better maintainability, standardized tooling, and improved integration with the broader agent ecosystem.

## Current State Analysis

### Legacy Implementation Assessment

The existing CEO Agent (Mimi) operates as a Python-based agent with the following characteristics:

| Component | Current Implementation | Architecture Pattern |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Core Logic | Python class inheriting from BaseAgent | Monolithic agent implementation |
| Configuration | Mixed YAML/Python configuration | Distributed configuration model |
| Task Processing | Keyword-based delegation logic | Simple pattern matching |
| Integration | Direct Python imports and calls | Tight coupling to Python ecosystem |
| Deployment | Standalone Python module | Manual deployment process |

### Delegation Capabilities

Mimi's current delegation logic supports routing to four primary C-suite agents:

| Target Agent | Keywords | Responsibility Domain |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| CFO Cash | financial, budget, quarterly | Financial management and analysis |
| CTO Alex | feature, application, security, infrastructure | Technical implementation and architecture |
| CMO Anova | marketing, campaign | Marketing strategy and execution |
| CCO Sage | community, outreach | Community engagement and outreach |

### Architecture Limitations

The current implementation presents several architectural constraints:

- **Technology Stack Fragmentation**: Python implementation in a primarily TypeScript ecosystem
- **Configuration Scatter**: Agent definition spread across multiple files
- **Integration Complexity**: Manual integration points with other system components
- **Deployment Dependencies**: Requires Python runtime environment
- **Testing Inconsistency**: Different testing patterns from other agents

## Target Architecture

### Unified Brain/Body Pattern

The refactored CEO Agent will adopt the established brain/body architecture pattern:

        end
        
        AgentDef --> Main
        Personality --> Orchestrator
        Instructions --> Delegator

        Registry[Agent Registry]
    end
    
    Body --> CSuite
    Router --> Body
    Registry --> Brain
```

### Component Architecture

The refactored agent will consist of four primary architectural components:

| Component | Responsibility | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Agent Definition (Brain)** | Configuration, personality, instructions | YAML file in centralized library |
| **Main Entry Point** | Initialization, health checks, status reporting | TypeScript class with standardized interface |
| **Strategic Orchestrator** | High-level strategic decision making | TypeScript service for complex orchestration |
| **Task Delegator** | Delegation logic and routing decisions | TypeScript service with enhanced routing |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

#### Nx Application Creation

The new CEO Agent will be implemented as an Nx application following established patterns:

**Directory Structure:**
```
os-workspace/apps/ceo-agent/

  agent_name: string;
  agent_type: 'STRATEGIC_LEADERSHIP';
  core_instructions: string;
  personality_traits: string[];
  required_tools: string[];
  delegation_rules: DelegationRule[];
  escalation_criteria: EscalationCriteria[];
}

interface DelegationRule {
  keywords: string[];
  target_agent: string;
  confidence_threshold: number;
  fallback_agents: string[];
}

interface EscalationCriteria {
  condition: string;
  threshold: number;
  action: 'human_review' | 'multi_agent' | 'executive_decision';
