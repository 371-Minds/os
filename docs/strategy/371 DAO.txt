371 Minds  **Top-Level DAO**

1. **Divisional Structure:**- **SubDAOs**
  - **Research & Development (R&D)**  - **Purpose:** To drive innovation, explore new technologies, and develop core AI/automation frameworks. This division will focus on the foundational elements that power the entire ecosystem.
  - **Business & Operations:**   - **Purpose:** To manage the operational efficiency, strategic growth, and business development of the revenue-generating and launch-ready portfolio companies. This division ensures smooth business execution and scaling.
  - **Content & Media**  - **Purpose:** To oversee the creation, distribution, and management of content across all media platforms, ensuring brand consistency and maximizing reach.
  - **Education & Community**   - **Purpose:** To foster learning, build community engagement, and develop educational resources across the ecosystem. This division will nurture user growth and knowledge sharing.
  - **Finance & Treasury**  - **Purpose:** To manage the overall financial health of the DAO, including treasury operations, budget allocation, investment strategies, and financial reporting. This division ensures fiscal responsibility and growth.  - **Relevant Functions:**
    -   Treasury management within DAO DAO (as seen in documents accessed on 2025-09-20T00:48:43 and 2025-09-20T01:04:51).
    -   Budget allocation for R&D, Business & Operations, Content & Media, and Education & Community SubDAOs.
    -   Financial reporting and projections.
    -   Management of revenue streams and potential investments.
    -   Oversight of the conceptual `Agent371DAO` contract's treasury functions (as discussed on 2025-09-12T23:23:43).
  - **Software Development**  - **Purpose:** This division will focus specifically on the development, maintenance, and deployment of software across the portfolio, ensuring technical excellence and adherence to architectural standards. Given the focus on autonomous agents and complex systems, this division is crucial for execution.  - **Relevant Companies/Products/Technologies:**
    -   General software development for all portfolio companies.
    -   Core infrastructure development (SmythOS, Portkey, Convex, Next.js, etc.).
    -   AI Agent development and integration (LocalAI, Tabby, MindsDB, etc.).
    -   Ensuring code quality, testing, and deployment pipelines (ACI.dev, Vercel).
    -   Cross-repository coordination and shared component development.
    -   This division would work closely with R&D and Business & Operations to bring products to market.
 
**DAO DAO Integration Notes:**
- **SubDAO Creation:** Each of these divisions can be implemented as a SubDAO within the main 371 Minds DAO using the DAO DAO platform. This allows for delegated governance and specialized management.
- **Treasury Management:** Each SubDAO can have its own treasury allocation from the main DAO's treasury, facilitating clear financial accountability for each division's initiatives.
- **Governance:** The governance structure within each SubDAO can be customized based on its specific needs (e.g., token-based for wider community participation in Content & Media, or more tightly controlled membership for R&D or Finance).

### 1. Core Vision and Mission Alignment

- "To build the world's first local-first, decentralized autonomous agent ecosystem that empowers individuals and organizations through hyper-personalized AI, community-driven governance, and radical cost efficiency."

### 2. Architectural Frameworks and Methodologies

- **371 Minds Autonomous Company Framework:** Detail the roles and responsibilities of agents like the CEO, Department Heads, and Company-Specific GM Agents. This is crucial for understanding how decisions will be made and executed. (Referenced in "FINAL IMPLEMENTATION REPORT" and "371 OS: Autonomous Agent Operating System Architecture" documents).
- **ModuMind R2R Corporate Methodology:** Document the "DISCOVER → SPACE → FLOW" cycle and how it will be applied across the organization. This methodology is central to iterative development and operational improvement. (Referenced in "FINAL IMPLEMENTATION REPORT").
- **DAO DAO and SubDAO Structure:** Clearly outline the chosen DAO platform ([DAO DAO](https://dao-dao-docs.gitbook.io/docs/)) and the proposed SubDAO structure for each division (R&D, Business & Operations, Content & Media, Education & Community, Finance & Treasury, Software Development). This includes understanding their purpose, relevant companies/products, and potential governance models. (Referenced extensively in past chat logs and DAO DAO documentation).
- **QuestFlow Swarm Architecture:** Document how QuestFlow will be utilized for C-Suite agent implementation, emphasizing the reduction in tech overhead and the focus on business logic. (Referenced in Genspark documents from 2025-09-12 and 2025-09-13).
Consulting Models: DSF, ELEVATE, Opposite Persona, ASAA

### 3. Technology Stack and Infrastructure
- **Core Technology Stack:** 
- **AI and Intelligence Stack:** 
- **Deployment Strategy:** Emphasize the use of the Akash Network for its cost-efficiency and decentralized nature

### 4. Revenue Streams and Monetization
- **Immediate Revenue Drivers:** 
- **Strategic Licensing Opportunities:** Detail the "371 Minds Corporate AI Operating System" licensing tiers (Startup, Growth, Enterprise, Custom).
- **Other Monetization Models:** 

### 5. Implementation Roadmaps and Timelines
- **Phased Implementation Plan:** Document the distinct phases (Foundation, Intelligence, Media & Automation, Later Integration, Advanced Features) with their associated goals, key deliverables, and timelines.
- **Specific Project Roadmaps:** Incorporate any specific project roadmaps, such as the one for "LyricLines" if it's a current focus.

### 6. Governance and Economic Models
- **DAO DAO Integration:** Document the specific configurations for the main DAO and its SubDAOs, including membership structures, voting mechanisms, and treasury management strategies. Reference the DAO DAO documentation for best practices.
- **Agent Compensation and Incentives:** Detail how agents will be compensated and incentivized, particularly within the context of the "autonomous agent economy" and the Status Network. (Referenced in "371 OS: Autonomous Agent Operating System Architecture").
- **Smart Contract Design:** Reference the conceptual `Agent371DAO` contract and any other smart contract designs related to governance and treasury management. (Referenced in the past chat log from 2025-09-12T23:23:43).
