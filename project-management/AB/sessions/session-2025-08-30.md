## 🚧 Current Blockers Identified

### Primary Blocker: Dependency Installation
- **Issue**: npm install hanging for 30+ minutes
- **Impact**: Prevents all runtime testing and validation
- **Root Cause**: Complex ElizaOS dependency chain with peer conflicts
- **Solution Status**: ✅ Recovery script created and executing
- **ETA**: 30-60 minutes for complete resolution

### Secondary Issues
- **ElizaOS Package Validation**: Correct package name needs verification
- **Plugin Compilation**: Pending dependency resolution
- **Agent Runtime Testing**: Blocked by dependencies
- **Blockchain Integration**: 50% complete, needs smart contract deployment

## 🛠️ Solutions Implemented

### npm Install Recovery Strategy
1. **Process Termination**: Killed hanging Node.js processes
2. **Environment Cleanup**: Cleared npm cache and node_modules
3. **Configuration Optimization**: Set legacy-peer-deps and registry
4. **Progressive Installation**: Install dependencies in isolated groups
5. **Core-First Approach**: Nx → TypeScript → Production → Development

### Installation Script Features
```powershell
# Key optimizations implemented:
- Dependency isolation strategy
- Legacy peer deps configuration  
- Registry optimization
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Progress monitoring and validation
- Automatic recovery procedures
```
